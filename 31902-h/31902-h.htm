    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE SICK LEAVE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Minette?&rdquo; said I, for the third time, as I saw her lean her
      head from out the narrow casement, and look down into the valley beside
      the river; &ldquo;what do you see there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see a regiment of infantry coming along the road from Ulm,&rdquo; said she,
      after a pause; &ldquo;and now I perceive the lancers are following them, and the
      artillery too. Ah! and farther again, I see a great cloud of dust. <i>Mère
      de Ciél!</i> how tired and weary they all look! It surely cannot be a
      march in retreat; and, now that I think of it, they have no baggage, nor
      any wagons with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a bugle call, Minette! Did you not hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's a halt for a few minutes. Poor fellows! they are sadly
      exhausted; they cannot even reach the side of the way, but are lying down
      on the very road. I can bear it no longer. I must find out what it all
      means.&rdquo; So saying, she threw round her a mantle which, Spanish fashion,
      she wore over her head, and hurried from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time I waited patiently for her return; but when half an hour
      elapsed, I arose and crept to the window. A succession of rocky precipices
      descended from the terrace on which the house stood, down to the very edge
      of the Danube, and from the point where I sat the view extended for miles
      in every direction. What, then, was my astonishment to see the wide plain,
      not marked by regular columns in marching array, but covered with
      straggling detachments, hurrying onward as if without order or discipline.
      Here was an infantry battalion mixed up with a cavalry corps, the
      foot-soldiers endeavoring to keep up with the ambling trot of the
      dragoons; there, the ammunition wagons were covered with weary soldiers,
      too tired to march. Most of the men were without their firelocks, which
      were piled in a confused heap on the limbers of the guns. No merry chant,
      no burst of warlike music, cheered them on. They seemed like the scattered
      fragments of a routed army hurrying onward in search of some place of
      refuge,-sad and spiritless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can he have been beaten?&rdquo; was the fearful thought that flashed across me
      as I gazed. &ldquo;Have the bold legions that were never vanquished succumbed at
      last? Oh, no, no! I'll not believe it.&rdquo; And while a glow of fever warmed
      my whole blood, I buckled on my sabre, and taking my shako, prepared to
      issue forth. Scarcely had I reached the door, with tottering limbs, when I
      saw Minette dashing up the steep street at the top speed of her pony,
      while she flourished above her head a great placard, and waved it to and
      fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The news! the news!&rdquo; cried I, bursting with anxiety. &ldquo;Are they advancing;
      or is it a retreat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that!&rdquo; said she, throwing me a large sheet of paper, headed with the
      words, &ldquo;Proclamation! la Grande Armée!&rdquo; in huge letters,-&ldquo;read that! for
      I've no breath left to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soldiers!&mdash;The campaign so gloriously begun will soon be completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One victory, and the Austrian empire, so great but a week since, will be
      humbled in the dust. Hasten on, then! Forced marches, by day and night,
      will attest your eagerness to meet the enemy; and let the endeavor of each
      regiment be to arrive soonest on the field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minette! dearest Minette!&rdquo; said I, as I threw my arms around her neck,
      &ldquo;this is indeed good news.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gently, gently, Monsieur!&rdquo; said she, smiling,
      while she disengaged herself from my sudden embrace. &ldquo;Very good news,
      without doubt; but I don't think that there is any mention in the bulletin
      about embracing the vivandières of the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a moment like this, Minette&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing to do is, to make up one's baggage and join the march,&rdquo;
       said she, very steadily, proceeding at the same time to put her plan into
      execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I gave her all assistance in my power, the doctor entered to inform
      us that all the wounded who were then not sufficiently restored to return
      to duty were to be conveyed to Munich, where general military hospitals
      had been established; and that he himself had received orders to repair
      thither with his sick detachment, in which my name was enrolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll keep your old friend, François, company, Lieutenant Burke; he is
      able to move at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;François!&rdquo; said I, in ecstasy; &ldquo;and will he indeed recover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have little doubt of it; though certainly he's not likely to practise
      as maître d'armes again. You 've spoiled his tierce, though not before it
      cost the army some of the prettiest fellows I ever saw. But as to yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for me, I 'll march with the army. I feel perfectly recovered; my arm&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as for monsieur's arms,&rdquo; said mademoiselle, &ldquo;I'll answer for it, they
      are quite at his Majesty's service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the doctor, knowingly; &ldquo;I thought it would come to that.
      Well, well, Mademoiselle, don't look saucy; let us part good friends for
      once in our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate being reconciled to a surgeon,&rdquo; said she, pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, I pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know, when one quarrels with an officer, the poor fellow may be
      killed before one sees him again; and it's always a sad thought, that. But
      your doctor, nothing ever happens to him; you're sure to see him, with his
      white apron and his horrid weapons, a hundred times after, and one is
      always sorry for having forgiven such a cruel wretch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Mademoiselle, you bear us all an ill-will for the fault of
      one, and that's not fair. It was the hospital aide of the Sixth, Monsieur,
      (a handsome fellow, too), who did not fall in love with her after her
      wound,&mdash;a slight scratch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A slight scratch, do you call it?&rdquo; said I, indignantly, as I perceived
      the poor girl's eyes fill at the raillery of her tormentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur has seen it, then?&rdquo; said he, maliciously. &ldquo;A thousand
      pardons. I have the honor to wish you both adieu.&rdquo; And with that, and a
      smile of the most impertinent meaning, he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How silly to be vexed for so little, Minette!&rdquo; said I, approaching and
      endeavoring to console her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but to call my wound a scratch!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Was it not too bad? and
      I the only vivandière of the army that ever felt a bullet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that she turned away her head; but I could see, as she wiped her
      eyes, that she cared less for the sarcasm on her wounded shoulder than the
      insult to her wounded heart. Poor girl! she looked sick and pale the whole
      day after.

      We learned in the course of the day that some cavalry detachments would
      pass early on the morrow, thus allowing us sufficient time to provide
      ourselves with horses, and make our other arrangements for the march.
      These we succeeded in doing to our satisfaction; I being fortunate enough
      to secure the charger of an Austrian prisoner, mademoiselle being already
      admirably mounted with her palfrey. Occupied with these details, the day
      passed rapidly over, and the hour for supper drew near without my feeling
      how the time slipped past.

    <p>
      At last the welcome meal made its appearance, and with it mademoiselle
      herself. I could not help remarking that her toilette displayed a more
      than common attention: her neat Parisian cap; her collar, with its deep
      Valenciennes lace; and her <i>tablier</i>, so coquettishly embroidered,&mdash;were
      all signs of an unusual degree of care; and though she was pale and in low
      spirits, I never saw her look so pretty. All my efforts to make her
      converse were, however, in vain. Some secret weight lay heavily on her
      spirits, and not even the stirring topics of the coming campaign could
      awaken one spark of her enthusiasm. She evaded, too, every allusion to the
      following day's march, or answered my questions about it with evident
      constraint. Tired at last with endeavoring to overcome her silent mood, I
      affected an air of chagrin, thinking to pique her by it; but she merely
      remarked that I appeared weary, and that, as I had a long journey before
      me, it were as well I should retire early.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marked coolness of her manner at this moment struck me so forcibly
      that I began really to feel some portion of the ill-temper I affected, and
      with the crossness of an over-petted child, I arose to withdraw at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Monsieur; good-night, I mean,&rdquo; said she, blushing slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said I, taking her hand coldly as I spoke. &ldquo;I
      trust I may find you in better spirits to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&mdash;adieu!&rdquo; said she, hastily; and before I could add a
      word she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a strange girl,&rdquo; thought I, as I found myself alone, and tortured
      my mind to think whether anything I could have dropped had offended her.
      But no: we had parted a few hours before the best friends in the world;
      nothing had then occurred to which I could attribute this sudden change. I
      had often remarked the variable character of her disposition,&mdash;the
      flashes of gayety mingled with outbursts of sorrow; the playful moods of
      fancy alternating with moments of deep melancholy; and, after all, this
      might be one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these thoughts I threw myself on my bed, but could not sleep. At one
      minute my brain went on puzzling about Minette and her sorrow; at the next
      I reproached myself for my own harsh, unfeeling manner to the poor girl,
      and was actually on the eve of arising to seek her and ask her pardon. At
      last sleep came, and dreams too; but, strange enough, they were of the
      distant land of my boyhood and the hours of my youth; of the old house in
      which I was born, and its well-remembered rooms. I thought I was standing
      before my father, while he scolded me for some youthful transgression; I
      heard his words as though they were really spoken, as he told me that I
      should be an outcast and a wanderer, without a friend, a house, or home;
      that while others reaped wealth and honors, I was destined to be a
      castaway: and in the torrent of my grief I awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was night,&mdash;dark, silent night. A few stars were shining in the
      sky, but the earth was wrapped in shadow; and as I opened my window to let
      the fresh breeze calm my fevered forehead, the deep precipice beneath me
      seemed a vast gulf of yawning blackness. At a great distance off I could
      see the watchfires of some soldiers bivouacking in the plain; and even
      that much comforted my saddened heart, as it aroused me to the thoughts of
      the campaign before me. But again my thoughts recurred to my dream, which
      I could not help feeling as a sort of prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When our sleep leaves its strong track in our waking moments, we dread to
      sleep again for fear the whole vision should come back; and thus I sat
      down beside the window, and fell into a long train of thought. The images
      of my dream were uppermost in my mind; and every little incident of
      childhood, long lost to memory, came now fresh before me,&mdash;the
      sorrows of my schoolboy years, unrelieved by the sense of love awaiting me
      at home; the clinging to all who seemed to feel or care for me; and the
      heart-sickening sorrow when I found that what I mistook for affection was
      merely pity: all save one,&mdash;my mother! Her mild, sad looks, so seldom
      cheered by a ray of pleasure,&mdash;I remember well how they fell on me!
      with such a thrilling sensation at my heart, and such a gush of
      thankfulness, as I felt then! Oh! if they who live with children knew how
      needful it is to open their hearts to all the little sorrows and woes of
      infant life; to teach confidence and to feed hope; to train up the
      creeping tendrils of young desire, and not to suffer them to lie
      straggling and tangled on the earth,&mdash;what a happier destiny would
      fall to the lot of many whose misfortunes in late life date from the
      crushed spirit of childhood!
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother I&mdash;I thought of her as she would bend oyer me at night, her
      last kiss pressed on my brow,&mdash;the healing balm of some sorrow for
      which my sobs were still breaking,&mdash;her pale, worn cheek, her white
      dress, her hand so bloodless and transparent, the very emblem of her
      malady. The tears started to my eyes and rolled heavily along my cheek, my
      chest heaved, and my heart beat till I could hear it. At this moment a
      slight rustle stirred the leaves: I listened, for the night was calm and
      still; not a breeze moved. Again I heard it close beside the window, on
      the little terrace which ran along the building, and occupied the narrow
      space beside the edge of the rock. Before I could imagine what it meant, a
      figure in white glided from the shade of the trees and approached the
      window. So excited was my mind, so wrought up my imagination by the
      circumstances of my dream and the thoughts that followed, that I cried
      out, in a voice of ecstasy, &ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; Suddenly the apparition stood
      still, and then as rapidly retreated, and was lost to view in the dark
      foliage. Maddened with intense excitement, I sprang from the window, and
      leaped out on the terrace. I called aloud; I ran about wildly, unmindful
      of the fearful precipice that yawned beside me. I searched every bush, I
      crept beneath each tree, but nothing could I detect. The cold perspiration
      poured down my face; my limbs trembled with a strange dread of I knew not
      what. I felt as if madness was creeping over me, and I struggled with the
      thought and tried to calm my troubled brain. Wearied and faint, I gave up
      the pursuit at last, and, throwing myself on my bed, I sank exhausted into
      the heavy slumber which only tired nature knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sous-Lieutenant Burke,&rdquo; said a gruff voice, awakening me suddenly
      from my sleep, while by the light of a lantern he held in his hand I
      recognized the figure of an orderly sergeant in full equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What then?&rdquo; said I, in some amazement at the summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the order of march, sir, for the invalid detachment under your
      command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? I have no orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are here, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he presented me with a letter from the assistant-adjutant of
      the corps, with instructions for the conduct of forty men, invalided from
      different regiments, and now on their way to Lintz. The paper was
      perfectly regular, setting forth the names of the soldiers and their
      several corps, together with the daily marches, the halts, and distances.
      My only surprise was how this service so suddenly devolved on me, whose
      recovery could only have been reported a few hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall I muster the detachment, sir?&rdquo; said the sergeant, interrupting
      me in the midst of my speculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&mdash;at once. It is past five o'clock. I see Langenau is mentioned
      as the first halting-place; we can reach it by eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment the sergeant withdrew, I arose and dressed for the road,
      anxious to inform mademoiselle as early as possible of this sudden order
      of march. When I entered the <i>salon</i>, I found to my surprise that the
      breakfast table was all laid and everything ready. &ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo;
       said I; &ldquo;has she heard it already?&rdquo; At the same instant I caught sight of
      the door of her chamber lying wide open. I approached, and looked in. The
      room was empty; the various trunks and boxes, the little relics of
      military glory I remembered to have seen with her, were all gone. Minette
      had departed; when or whither, I knew not. I hurried through the building,
      from room to room, without meeting any one. The door was open, and I
      passed out into the dark street, where all was still and silent as the
      grave. I hastened to the stable: my horse, ready equipped and saddled, was
      feeding; but the stall beside him was empty,&mdash;the pony of the
      vivandière was gone. While many a thought flashed on my brain as to her
      fate, I tortured my mind to remember each circumstance of our last
      meeting,&mdash;every word and every look; and as I called to my memory the
      pettish anger of my manner towards her, I grew sick at heart, and hated
      myself for my own cold ingratitude. All her little acts of kindness, her
      tender care, her unwearying good-nature, were before me. I thought of her
      as I had seen her often in the silence of the night, when, waking from
      some sleep of pain, she sat beside my bed, her hand pressed on my heated
      forehead; her low, clear voice was in my ear; her soft, mild look, beaming
      with hope and tender pity. Poor Minette! had I then offended you? was such
      the return I made for all your kindness?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men are ready, sir,&rdquo; said the sergeant, entering at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is gone,&rdquo; said I, following out my own sad train of thought, and
      pointing to the vacant stall where her pony used to stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Minette&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, what of her&mdash;where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marched with the cuirassier brigade that passed here last night at twelve
      o'clock. She seemed very ill, sir, and the officer made her sit on one of
      the wagons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which road did they take? »
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They crossed the river, and moved away towards the forest. I think I
      heard the troop-sergeant say something about Salzburg and the Tyrol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer, but stood mute and stupefied; when I was again recalled
      to thought by his asking if my baggage was ready for the wagons.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sullen apathy I pointed out my trunks in silence, and throwing one
      last look on the room, the scene of my former suffering, and of much
      pleasure too, I mounted my horse, and gave the word to move forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we passed from the gate, I stopped to question the sous-officier as to
      the route of the cuirassier division. But he could only repeat what the
      sergeant had already told me; adding, there were several men slightly
      wounded in the squadrons, for they had been engaged twice within the week.
      The gates closed! and we were on the highroad.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. LINTZ
    </h2>
    <p>
      As day was breaking, we came up with a strong detachment of the cavalry of
      the Guard proceeding to join Bessiere's division at Lintz. From them we
      learned that the main body of the army was already far in advance, several
      entire corps having marched from Lintz with the supposed intention of
      occupying Vienna. Ney's division, it was said, was also bearing down from
      the Tyrol; Davoust and Mortier were advancing by the left bank of the
      Danube; whilst Lannes and Murat, with an overwhelming force of light
      troops, had pushed forward two days' march in advance on their way to the
      capital. The fate of Ulm was already predicted for the Austrian city, and
      each day's intelligence seemed to make it only the more inevitable.
      Meanwhile the Emperor Francis had abandoned the capital, and retreated on
      Brunn, a fortified town in Moravia, there to await the arrival of his
      ally, Alexander, hourly expected from Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As day after day we pressed forward, our numbers continued to increase. A
      motley force, indeed, did we present: cavalry of every sort, from the
      steel-clad cuirassier to the gay hussar, dragoons, chasseurs, guides, and
      light cavalry, all mixed up together, and all eagerly recounting the
      several experiences of the campaign as it fell under their eyes in
      different quarters. From none, however, could I learn any tidings of
      Minette; for though known to many there, the detachment she had joined had
      taken a southerly direction, and was not crossed by any of the others on
      their march. The General d'Auvergne, I heard, was with the headquarters of
      the Emperor, then established at the monastery of Molk, on the Danube.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the 13th of November we arrived at Lintz, the capital of
      Upper Austria, but at the time I speak of one vast barrack. Thirty-eight
      thousand troops of all arms were within its walls; not subject to the
      rigid discipline and regular command of a garrison town, but bivouacking
      in the open streets and squares. Tables were spread in the thoroughfares,
      at which the divisions as they arrived took their places, and after
      refreshing themselves, moved on to make way for others. The great churches
      were strewn with forage, and filled with the horses of the cavalry; there
      might be seen the lumbering steeds of the cuirassier, eating their corn
      from the richly-carved box of a confessional; here lay the travel-stained
      figure of a dragoon, stretched asleep across the steps of the altar. The
      little chapelries, where the foot of the penitent awoke no echo as it
      passed, now rung with the coarse jest and reckless ribaldry of the
      soldiers; parties caroused in the little sacristies; and the rude chorus
      of a drinking song now vibrated through the groined roof where only the
      sacred notes of the organ had been heard to peal. The Hôtel de Ville was
      the quartier-général, where the generals of divisions were assembled, and
      from which the orderlies rode forth at every moment with despatches. The
      one cry, &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; was heard everywhere. They who before had claimed
      leave for slight wounds or illness, were now seen among their comrades
      with bandaged arms and patched faces, eager to press on. Many whose
      regiments were in advance became incorporated for the time with other
      corps; and dismounted dragoons were often to be met with, marching with
      the infantry and mounting guard in turn. Everything bespoke haste. The
      regiments which arrived at night frequently moved off before day broke.
      The cavalry often were provided with fresh horses to press forward,
      leaving their own for the corps that were to follow. A great flotilla,
      provided with all the necessaries for an army on the march, moved along
      the Danube, and accompanied the troops each day. In a word, every
      expedient was practised which could hasten the movement of the army;
      justifying the remark so often repeated among the soldiers at the time,
      &ldquo;Le Petit Caporal makes more use of our legs than our bayonets in this
      campaign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the same evening we arrived came the news of the surprise of Vienna by
      Murat. Never was there such joy as this announcement spread through the
      army. The act itself was one of those daring feats which only such as he
      could venture on, and indeed at first seemed so miraculous that many
      refused to credit it. Prince Auersberg, to whom the great bridge of the
      Danube was intrusted, had prepared everything for its destruction in the
      event of attack. The whole line of woodwork was laid with combustibles;
      trains were set, the matches burning; a strong battery of twelve guns,
      posted to command the bridge, occupied the height on the right bank, and
      the Austrian gunners lay, match in hand, beside their pieces: but a word
      was needed, and the whole work was in a blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of matters when Sebastiani pushed through the faubourg
      of the Leopoldstadt at the head of a strong cavalry detachment, supported
      by some grenadiers of the Guard, and by Murat's orders, concealed his
      force among the narrow streets which lead to the bridge from the left bank
      of the Danube. This done, Lannes and Murat advanced carelessly along the
      bridge, which, from the frequent passage of couriers between the two
      headquarters, had become a species of promenade, where the officers of
      either side met to converse on the fortunes of the campaign. Dressed
      simply as officers of the staff, they strolled along till they came
      actually beneath the Austrian battery; and then entered into conversation
      with the Austrian officers, assuring them that the armistice was signed,
      and peace already proclaimed between the two countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Austrians, trusting to their story, and much interested by what they
      heard, descended from the mound, and joining them, proceeded to walk
      backwards and forwards along the bridge, conversing on the probable
      consequences of the treaty; when suddenly turning round by chance, as they
      walked towards the right bank, they saw the head of a grenadier column
      approaching at the quick step. The thought of treachery crossed their
      minds; and one of them, rushing to the side of the bridge, called out to
      the artillerymen to fire. A movement was seen in the battery, the matches
      were uplifted, when Murat, dashing forward, cried aloud, &ldquo;Reserve your
      fire; there is nothing to fear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same instant the Austrian officers were surrounded; the sappers
      rushing on the bridge cleared away the combustibles, and cut off the
      trains; and the cavalry, till now in concealment, pushing forward at a
      gallop, crossed the bridge, followed by the grenadiers in a run,&mdash;before
      the Austrians, who saw their own officers mingled with the French, could
      decide on what was to be done,&mdash;while Murat, springing on his horse,
      dashed forward at the head of the dragoons; and before five minutes
      elapsed the battery was stormed, the gunners captured, and Vienna won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was there a <i>coup de main</i> more hardy than this, whether we
      look to the danger of the deed itself, or the insignificant force by which
      it was accomplished. A few horsemen and some companies of foot, led on by
      an heroic chief, thus turned the whole fortune of Europe; for, by securing
      this bridge, Napoleon enabled himself, as circumstances might warrant, to
      unite the different corps of his army on the right or left banks of the
      Danube, and either direct his operations against the Russians, or the
      Austrians under the Archduke Charles, as he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The treachery by which the bold deed was made successful, was, alas!
      deemed no stain on the achievement. But one rule of judgment existed in
      the Imperial army: Was the advantage on the side of France, and to the
      honor of her arms? That covered every flaw, no matter whether inflicted by
      duplicity or breach of faith. The habit of healing all wounds of
      conscience by a bulletin had become so general, that men would not trust
      to the guidance of their own reason till confirmed by some Imperial
      proclamation; and when the Emperor declared a battle gained and glory
      achieved, who would gainsay him? If this blind, headlong confidence tended
      to lower the <i>morale</i> of the nation, in an equal degree did it make
      them conquerors in the field; and thus&mdash;by a strange decree of
      Providence, would it seem&mdash;were they preparing for themselves the
      terrible reverse of fortune which, when the destinies of their leader
      became clouded and their confidence in him shaken, was to fall on a people
      who lived only in the mad intoxication of victory, and knew not the
      sterner virtues that can combat with defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But so was it. Napoleon commanded the legions and described their
      achievements; he led them to the charge and he apportioned their glory;
      the heroism of the soldier had no existence until acknowledged by the
      proclamation after the battle; the valor of the general wanted
      confirmation till sealed by his approval. To fight beneath his eyes was
      the greatest glory a regiment could wish for; to win one word from him was
      fame itself forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I dwell on these thoughts here, it is because I now felt for the first
      time the sad deception I had practised on myself; and how little could I
      hope to realize in my soldier's life the treasured aspirations of my
      boyhood Î Was this, then, indeed the career I had pictured to my mind,&mdash;the
      chivalrous path of honor? Was this the bold assertion of freedom I so
      often dreamed of? How few of that armed host knew anything of the causes
      of the war,&mdash;how much fewer still cared for them! No sentiment of
      patriotism, no devotion to the interests of liberty or humanity, prompted
      us on. Yet these were the thoughts first led me to the career of arms;
      such ambitious promptings first made my heart glow with the enthusiasm of
      a soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gloomy disappointment made me low-spirited and sad. Nor can I say
      where such reflections might not have led me, when suddenly a change came
      over my thoughts by seeing a wounded soldier, who had just arrived from
      Mortier's division, with news of a fierce encounter they had sustained
      against Kutusof's Russians. The poor fellow was carried past in a litter,&mdash;his
      arm had been amputated that same morning, and a frightful shot-wound had
      carried away part of his cheek; still, amid all his suffering, his eye was
      brilliant, and a smile of proud meaning was on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lift it up, Guillaume; let me see it again,&rdquo; said he, as they bore him
      along the crowded street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it he wishes?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The poor fellow is asking for something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mon lieutenant. It is the <i>sabre d'honneur</i> the Emperor gave
      him this morning. He likes to look at it every now and then; he says he
      doesn't mind the pain when he sees that before him. <i>And it is natural,
      too.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is glory!&rdquo; said I to myself; &ldquo;and he who feels this in his heart has
      no room for other thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, give to me the trumpet's blast, And the champ of the charger
      prancing; Or the whiz of the grape-shot flying past, That 'a music meet
      for dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tralararalal&rdquo; sang a wild-looking voltigeur, as he capered along the
      street, keeping time to his rude song with the tramp of his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! there goes a fellow from the Faubourg!&rdquo; said an officer near me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Faubourg?&rdquo; repeated I, asking for explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure. The Faubourg St. Antoine supplies all the reckless
      devils of the army; one of them would corrupt a regiment, and so, the best
      thing to do is to keep them as much together as possible. The voltigeurs
      have little else; and proof is, they are the cleverest corps in the
      service, and if they could be kept from picking and stealing, lying,
      drinking, and gambling, there's not a man might not be a general of
      division in time. There goes another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, a fellow passed by with a goose under his arm, followed by a
      woman most vociferously demanding restitution; while he only amused
      himself by replying with a mock courtesy, deploring in sad terms the
      unhappy necessities of war and the cruel hardships of a campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use punishing those fellows,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;They desert in
      whole companies if you send one to the <i>salle de police</i>; and so we
      have only one resource, which is, to throw them pretty much in advance,
      and leave their chastisement to the enemy. And, sooth to say, they ask for
      nothing better themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, even these fellows seemed to have their own sentiment of glory,&mdash;a
      problem which the more I reasoned over the more puzzled did I become.
    </p>
    <p>
      While a hundred conjectures were hourly in circulation, none save those
      immediately about the person of Napoleon could possibly divine the quarter
      where the great blow was to be struck, although all were in expectation of
      the orders to prepare for battle. News would reach us of marchings and
      counter-marchings; of smart skirmishes here, and prisoners taken there;
      yet could we not form the slightest conception of where the chief force of
      the enemy lay, nor what the direction to which our own army was pointed.
      Indeed, our troops seemed to scatter on every side. Marmont, with a strong
      force, was despatched towards Gratz, where it was said the Archduke
      Charles was at the head of a considerable army; Davoust moved on Hungary,
      and occupied Presburg; Bernadotte retraced his steps towards the Upper
      Danube, to hold the Archduke Frederick in check, who had escaped from Ulm
      with ten thousand men; Mortiers corps, harassed and broken by the
      engagement with Kutusof, were barely sufficient to garrison Vienna; while
      Soult, Lannes, and Murat pushed forward towards Moravia, with a strong
      cavalry force and some battalions of the Guard. In fact, the whole army
      was scattered like an exploded shell; nor could we see the means by which
      its wide extended fragments were to be united at a moment, much less
      divine the spot to which their combined force was to be directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had these Russians been fabulous creatures of a legend, instead of men of
      mortal mould, they could scarcely have been endowed with more attributes
      of ubiquity than we conferred on them. Sometimes we believed them at one
      side of the Danube, sometimes at the other; now we heard of them as
      retreating by forced marches into their native fastnesses, now as encamped
      in the mountain regions of Moravia. Yesterday came the news that they laid
      down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war; to-day we heard of
      them as having forced back our advanced posts and carried off several
      squadrons as prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length came the positive information that the allied armies were in
      cantonments around Olmutz; while Napoleon had pushed forward to Brunn, a
      place of considerable strength, communicating by the highroad with the
      Russian headquarters. It was no longer doubtful, then, where the great
      game was to be decided, and thither the various battalions were now
      directed by marches day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 29th of November our united detachments, now numbering several
      hundred men, arrived at Brunn. I lost no time in repairing to
      headquarters, where I found General d'Auvergne deeply engaged with the
      details of the force under his command: his brigade had been placed under
      the orders of Murat; and it was well known the prince gave little rest or
      respite to those under his command. From him I learned that three days of
      unsuccessful negotiation had just passed over, and that the Emperor had
      now resolved on a great battle. Indeed, every moment was critical. Russia
      had assumed a decidedly hostile aspect; the Swedes were moving to the
      south; the Archduke Charles, by a circuitous route, was on the march to
      join the Russian army, to whose aid fresh reinforcements were daily
      arriving, and Benningsen was hourly expected with more. Under these
      circumstances a battle was inevitable; and such a one, as, by its result,
      must conclude the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      This much did I learn from the old general as we rode over the field
      together; examining with caution the nature of the ground, and where it
      offered facilities, and where it presented obstacles, to the movement of
      cavalry. Such were the orders issued that morning by Napoleon to the
      generals of brigade, who might now be seen with their staffs traversing
      the plain in every direction. As we moved along we could discover in the
      distance the dark columns of the enemy marching, not towards us, but in a
      southerly direction towards our extreme right. This movement attracted the
      attention of several others, and more than one aide-de-camp was despatched
      to Brunn to carry the intelligence to the Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening couriers departed in every direction to Bernadotte and
      Davoust to hasten forward at once; even Mortier, with his mangled
      division, was ordered to abandon Vienna to a division of Marmont's army,
      and move on to Brunn. And now the great work of concentration began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Russians advanced, and on the 30th drove in an advanced
      post, and compelled our cavalry to fall back behind our position. The
      following morning the allies resumed their flank movement. And now no
      doubt could be entertained of their plan; which was, by turning our right,
      to cut us off from our supporting columns resting at Vienna, and throw our
      retreat back upon the mountainous districts of Bohemia. In this way five
      massive columns moved past us scarce half a league distant from our
      advanced posts, numbering eighty thousand men, of which fifteen were
      cavalry in the most perfect condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our position was in advance of the fortress of Brunn; the headquarters of
      the Emperor occupied a rising piece of ground, at the base of which flowed
      a small stream, a tributary to some of the numerous ponds by which the
      field was intersected. The entire ground in our front was indeed a
      succession of these small lakes, with villages interspersed, and
      occasionally some stunted woods; great morasses extended around these
      ponds, through which led the highroads or such bypaths as conducted from
      one village to another. Here and there were plains where cavalry might act
      with safety, but rarely in large bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our right rested on the lake of Moeritz, where Soult's division was
      stationed; behind which, thrown back in such a manner as to escape the
      observation of the enemy, was Davoust's corps, the reserve occupying a
      cliff of ground beside the convent of Eeygern. Our left, under Lannes,
      occupied the hill of Santon,&mdash;a wooded eminence, the last of a long
      chain of mountains running east and west. Above, and on the crest of the
      height, a powerful park of artillery was posted, and defended by strong
      intrenchments. A powerful cavalry corps was placed at the bottom of the
      mountain. Next came Bernadotte's division, separated by the highroad from
      Brunn to Olmutz from the division under Murat, which, besides his own
      cavalry, contained Oudinot's grenadiers and Bessière's battalions of the
      Imperial Guard; the centre and right being formed of Soult's division, the
      strongest of all; the reserve, consisting of several battalions of the
      Guard and a strong force of artillery, being under the immediate orders of
      Napoleon, to be employed wherever circumstances demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the dispositions for the coming battle, made with all the
      precision of troops moving on parade; and such was the discipline of the
      army at Boulogne, and so perfectly arranged the plans of the Emperor, that
      the ground of every regiment was marked out, and each corps moved into its
      allotted space with the regularity of some piece of mechanism.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. AUSTERLITZ
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dispositions for the battle of Austerlitz occupied the entire day.
      From sunrise Napoleon was on horse-back, visiting every position; he
      examined each battery with the skill of an old officer of artillery; and
      frequently dismounting from his horse, carefully noted the slightest
      peculiarities of the ground,&mdash;remarking to his staff, with an
      accuracy which the event showed to be prophetic, the nature of the
      struggle, as the various circumstances of the field indicated them to his
      practised mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already late when he turned his horse's head towards the bivouac
      hut,&mdash;a rude shelter of straw,&mdash;and rode slowly through the
      midst of that great army. The <i>ordre du jour</i>, written at his own
      dictation, had just been distributed among the soldiers; and now around
      every watchfire the groups were kneeling to read the spirit-stirring lines
      by which he so well knew how to excite the enthusiasm of his followers.
      They were told that &ldquo;the enemy were the same Russian battalions they had
      already beaten at Hollabrunn, and on whose flying traces they had been
      marching ever since.&rdquo; &ldquo;They will endeavor,&rdquo; said the proclamation, &ldquo;to
      turn our right, but in doing so they must open their flank to us: need I
      say what will be the result? Soldiers, so long as with your accustomed
      valor you deal death and destruction in their ranks, so long shall I
      remain beyond the reach of fire; but let the victory prove, even for a
      moment, doubtful, your Emperor shall be in the midst of you. This day must
      decide forever the honor of the infantry of France. Let no man leave his
      ranks to succor the wounded,&mdash;they shall be cared for by one who
      never forgets his soldiers,&mdash;and with this victory the campaign is
      ended!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never were lines better calculated to stimulate the energy and flatter the
      pride of those to whom they were addressed. It was a novel thing in a
      general to communicate to his army the plan of his intended battle, and
      perhaps to any other than a French army the disclosure would not have been
      rated as such a favor; but their warlike spirit and military intelligence
      have ever been most remarkably united, and the men were delighted with
      such a proof of confidence and esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dull roar, like the sound of the distant sea, swelled along the lines
      from the far right, where the Convent of Reygern stood, and growing louder
      by degrees, proclaimed that the Emperor was coming. It was already dark,
      but he was quickly recognized by the troops, and with one burst of
      enthusiasm they seized upon the straw of their bivouacs, and setting fire
      to it, held the blazing masses above their heads, waving them wildly to
      and fro, amid the cries of &ldquo;Vive l'Empereur!&rdquo; For above a league along the
      plain the red light flashed and glowed, marking out beneath it the dense
      squares and squadrons of armed warriors. It was the anniversary of
      Napoleon's coronation; and such was the fête by which they celebrated the
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor rode through the ranks uncovered. Never did a prouder smile
      light up his features, while thronging around him the veterans of the
      Guard struggled to catch even a passing glance at him. &ldquo;Do but look at us
      tomorrow, and keep beyond the reach of shot,&rdquo; said a <i>grognard</i>,
      stepping forward; &ldquo;we'll bring their cannon and their colors, and lay them
      at thy feet.&rdquo; The marshals themselves, the hardened veterans of so many
      fights, could not restrain their enthusiasm; and proffers of devotion unto
      death accompanied him as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last all was silent in the encampment; the soldiers slept beside their
      watchfires, and save the tramp of a patrol or the <i>qui vive</i>? of the
      sentinels, all was still. The night was cold and sharp; a cutting wind
      blew across the plain, which gave way to a thick mist,&mdash;so thick, the
      sentries could scarcely see a dozen paces off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat in my little hovel of straw,&mdash;my mind far too much excited for
      sleep,&mdash;watching the stars as they peeped out one by one, piercing
      the gray mist, until at last the air became thin and clear, and a frosty
      atmosphere succeeded to the weighty fog; and now I could trace out the
      vast columns, as they lay thickly strewn along the plain. The old general,
      wrapped in his cloak, slept soundly on his straw couch; his deep-drawn
      breathing showed that his rest was unbroken. How slowly did the time seem
      to creep along! I thought it must be nigh morning, and it was only a
      little more than midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our position was a small rising ground about a mile in front of the left
      centre, and communicating with the enemy's line by a narrow road between
      the marshes. This had been defended by a battery of four guns, with a
      stockade in front; and along it now, for a considerable distance, a chain
      of sentinels were placed, who should communicate any movement that they
      observed in the Russian lines, of which I was charged to convey the
      earliest intelligence to the quartier-général. This duty alone would have
      kept me in a state of anxiety, had not the frame of my mind already so
      disposed me; and I could not avoid creeping out from time to time, to peer
      through the gloom in the direction of the enemy's camp, and listen with an
      eager ear for any sounds from that quarter. At last I heard the sound of a
      voice at some distance off; then, a few minutes after, the hurried step of
      feet, and a voltigeur came up, breathless with haste: &ldquo;The Russians were
      in motion towards the right. Our advanced posts could hear the roll of
      guns and tumbrels moving along the plain, and it was evident their columns
      were in march.&rdquo; I knelt down and placed my ear to the ground, and almost
      started at the distinctness with which I could hear the dull sound of the
      large guns as they were dragged along; the earth seemed to tremble beneath
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I awoke the general at once, who, resting on his arm, coolly heard my
      report; and having directed me to hasten to headquarters with the news,
      lay back again, and was asleep before I was in my saddle. At the top speed
      of my horse I galloped to the rear, winding my way between the battalions,
      till I came to a gentle rising ground, where, by the light of several
      large fires that blazed in a circle I could see the dismounted troopers of
      the <i>chasseurs à cheval</i>, who always formed the Imperial Bodyguard.
      Having given the word, I was desired by the officer of the watch to
      dismount, and following him, I passed forward to a space in the middle of
      the circle, where, under shelter of some sheaves of straw piled over each
      other, sat three officers, smoking beside a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! here comes news of some sort,&rdquo; said a voice I knew at once to be
      Murat's. &ldquo;Well, sir, what is't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Russian columns are in motion, Monsieur le Maréchal; the artillery
      moving rapidly towards our right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Diantre!</i> it's not much more than midnight! Davoust, shall we awake
      the Emperor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said a harsh voice, as a shrivelled, hard-featured man turned
      round from the blaze, and showing a head covered by a coarse woollen cap,
      looked far more like a pirate than a marshal of France; &ldquo;they 'll not
      attack before day breaks. Go back,&rdquo; said he, addressing me; &ldquo;observe the
      position well, and if there be any general movement towards the southward,
      you may report it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time I regained my post, all was in silence once more; either the
      Russians had arrested their march, or already their columns were out of
      hearing,&mdash;not a gleam of light could I perceive along their entire
      position. And now, worn out with watching, I threw myself down among the
      straw, and slept soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there! that's the third!&rdquo; said General d'Auvergne, shaking me by
      the shoulder; &ldquo;there again! Don't you hear the guns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I listened, and could just distinguish the faint booming sound of far-off
      artillery coming up from the extreme right of our position. It was still
      but three o'clock, and although the sky was thick with stars, perfectly
      dark in the valley. Meanwhile we could bear the galloping of cavalry quite
      distinctly in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount, Burke, and back to the quartier-général! But you need not; here
      comes some of the staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, D'Auvergne,&rdquo; cried a voice whose tones were strange to me, &ldquo;they
      meditate a night attack, it would seem; or is it only trying the range of
      their guns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the latter, Monsieur le Maréchal, for I heard no small arms; and,
      even now, all is quiet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are right,&rdquo; said he, moving slowly forward, while a number
      of officers followed at a little distance. &ldquo;You see, D'Auvergne, how
      correctly the Emperor judged their intentions. The brunt of the battle
      will be about Reygern. But there! don't you hear bugles in the valley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the music of our tirailleurs' bugles arose from the glen in
      front of our centre, where, in a thick beech-wood, the light infantry
      regiments were posted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, D'Esterre?&rdquo; said he to an officer who galloped up at the
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say the Russian Guard, sir, is moving to the front; our skirmishers
      have orders to fall back without firing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he heard this, the Marshal Bernadotte&mdash;for it was he&mdash;turned
      his horse suddenly round, and rode back, followed by his staff. And now
      the drums beat to quarters along the line, and the hoarse trumpets of the
      cavalry might be heard summoning the squadrons throughout the field; while
      between the squares, and in the intervals of the battalions, single
      horsemen galloped past with orders. Soult's division, which extended for
      nearly a league to our right, was the first to move, and it seemed like
      one vast shadow creeping along the earth, as column beside column marched
      steadily onward. Our brigade had not as yet received orders, but the men
      were in readiness beside the horses, and only waiting for the word to
      mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suspense of the moment was fearful. All that I had ever dreamed or
      pictured to myself of a soldier's enthusiasm was faint and weak, compared
      to the rush of sensations I now experienced. There must be a magic power
      of ecstasy in the approach of danger,&mdash;some secret sense of bounding
      delight, mingled with the chances of a battle,&mdash;that renders one
      intoxicated with excitement. Each booming gun I heard sent a wild throb
      through me, and I panted for the word &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Column after column moved past us, and disappeared in the dip of ground
      beneath; and as we saw the close battalions filling the wide plain in
      front, we sighed to think that it was destined to be the day of glory
      peculiarly to the infantry. Wherever the nature of the field permitted
      shelter or the woods afforded cover, our troops were sent immediately to
      occupy. The great manoeuvre of the day was to be the piercing of the
      enemy's centre whenever he should weaken that point by the endeavor to
      turn our right flank.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint streak of gray light was marking the horizon when the single guns
      which we had heard at intervals ceased; and then, after a short pause, a
      long, loud roll of artillery issued from the distant right, followed by
      the crackling din of small-arms, which increased at every moment, and now
      swelled into an uninterrupted noise, through which the large guns pealed
      from time to time. A red glare, obscured now and then by means of black
      smoke, lit up the sky in that quarter, where already the battle was raging
      fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrow causeway between the two small lakes in our front conducted to
      an open space of ground, about a cannon-shot from the Russian line; and
      this we were now ordered to occupy, to be prepared to act as support to
      the infantry of Soult's left, whenever the attack began. As we debouched
      into the plain, I beheld a group of horsemen, who, wrapped up in their
      cloaks, sat motionless in their saddles, calmly regarding the squadrons as
      they issued from the wood: these were Murat and his staff, to whom was
      committed the attack on the Russian Guard. His division consisted of the
      hussars and chasseurs under Kellermann, the cuirassiers of D'Auvergne, and
      the heavy dragoons of Nansouty,&mdash;making a force of eight thousand
      sabres, supported by twenty pieces of field artillery. Again were we
      ordered to dismount, for although the battle continued to rage on the
      right, the whole of the centre and left were unengaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus stood we as the sun arose,&mdash;that &ldquo;Sun of Austerlitz!&rdquo; so often
      appealed to and apostrophized by Napoleon as gilding the greatest of his
      glories. The mist from the lakes shut out the prospect of the enemy's
      lines at first; but gradually this moved away, and we could perceive the
      dark columns of the Russians, as they moved rapidly along the side of the
      Pratzen, and continued to pour their thousands towards Reygern.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the roar of musketry swelled louder and nearer, and an officer
      galloping past told us that Soult's right had been called up to support
      Davoust's division. This did not look well; it proved the Russians had
      pressed our lines closely, and we waited impatiently to hear further
      intelligence. It was evident, too, that our right was suffering severely,
      otherwise the attack on the centre would not have been delayed. Just then
      a wild cheer to the front drew our attention thither, and we saw the heads
      of three immense columns&mdash;Soult's division&mdash;advancing at a run
      towards the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Par Saint Louis</i>,&rdquo; cried General d'Auvergne, as he directed his
      telescope on the Russian line, &ldquo;those fellows have lost their senses! See
      if they have not moved their artillery away from the Pratzen, and weakened
      their centre more and more! Soult sees it: mark how he presses his columns
      on! There they go, faster and faster! But look! there's a movement yonder,&mdash;the
      Russians perceive their mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount!&rdquo; was now heard from squadron to squadron; while dashing along the
      line like a thunderbolt, Murat rode far in advance of his staff, the men
      cheering him as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried D'Auvergne, as he pointed with his finger, &ldquo;that column
      with the yellow shoulder-knots,&mdash;that's Vandamme's brigade of light
      infantry; see how they rush on, eager to be first up with the enemy. But
      St. Hilaire's grenadiers have got the start of them, and are already at
      the foot of the hill. It is a race between them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so had it become. The two columns advanced, cheering wildly; while the
      officers, waving their caps, led them on, and others rode along the flanks
      urging the men forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order now came for our squadrons to form in charging sections, leaving
      spaces for the light artillery between. This done, we moved slowly forward
      at a walk, the guns keeping step by step beside us. A few minutes after,
      we lost sight of the attacking columns; but the crashing fire told us they
      were engaged, and that already the great struggle had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      For above an hour we remained thus; every stir, every word loud spoken,
      seeming to our impatience like the order to move. At last, the squadrons
      to our right were seen to advance; and then a tremulous motion of the
      whole line showed that the horses themselves participated in the eagerness
      of the moment; and, at last, the word came for the cuirassiers to move up.
      In less than a hundred yards we were halted again; and I heard an
      aide-de-camp telling General d'Auvergne that Davoust had suffered
      immensely on the right; that his division, although reinforced, had fallen
      back behind Reygern, and all now depended on the attack of Soult's
      columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard no more, for now the whole line advanced in trot, and as our
      formation showed an unbroken front, the word came,&mdash;&ldquo;Faster!&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Faster!&rdquo; As we emerged from the low ground we saw Soult's column already
      half way up the ascent; they seemed like a great wedge driven into the
      enemy's centre, which, opening as they advanced, presented two surfaces of
      fire to their attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The battery yonder has opened its fire on our line,&rdquo; said D'Auvergne; &ldquo;we
      cannot remain where we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&mdash;charge!&rdquo; came the word from front to rear, and squadron
      after squadron dashed madly up the ascent. The one word only, &ldquo;Charge!&rdquo;
       kept ringing through my head; all else was drowned in the terrible din of
      the advance. An Austrian brigade of light cavalry issued forth as we came
      up, but soon fell back under the overwhelming pressure of our force. And
      now we came down upon the squares of the red-brown Russian infantry.
      Volley after volley sent back our leading squadrons, wounded and repulsed,
      when, unlimbering with the speed of lightning, the horse artillery poured
      in a discharge of grapeshot. The ranks wavered, and through their cleft
      spaces of dead and dying our cuirassiers dashed in, sabring all before
      them. In vain the infantry tried to form again: successive discharges of
      grape, followed by cavalry attacks, broke through their firmest ranks; and
      at last retreating, they fell back under cover of a tremendous battery of
      field-guns, which, opening their fire, compelled us to retire into the
      wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were we long inactive. Bernadotte's division was now engaged on our
      left, and a pressing demand came for cavalry to support them. Again we
      mounted the hill, and came in sight of the Russian Guard, led on by the
      Grand-Duke Constantino himself,&mdash;a splendid body of men, conspicuous
      for their size and the splendor of their equipment. Such, however, was the
      impetuous torrent of our attack that they were broken in an instant; and
      notwithstanding their courage and devotion, fresh masses of our dragoons
      kept pouring down upon them, and they were sabred, almost to a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were thus engaged, the battle became general from left to right,
      and the earth shook beneath the thundering sounds of two hundred great
      guns. Our position, for a moment victorious, soon changed; for having
      followed the retreating squadrons too far, the waves closed behind us, and
      we now saw that a dense cloud of Austrian and Russian cavalry were forming
      in our rear. An instant of hesitation would have been fatal. It was then
      that a tall and splendidly-dressed horseman broke from the line, and with
      a cry to &ldquo;Follow!&rdquo; rode straight at the enemy. It was Murat himself, sabre
      in hand, who, clearing his way through the Russians, opened a path for us.
      A few minutes after we had gained the wood; but one third of our force had
      fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cavalry! cavalry!&rdquo; cried a field-officer, riding down at headlong speed,
      his face covered with blood from a sabre-cut, &ldquo;to the front!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The order was given to advance at a gallop; and we found ourselves next
      instant hand to hand with the Russian dragoons, who having swept along the
      flank of Bernadotte's division, were sabring them on all sides. On we
      went, reinforced by Nansouty and his carabineers, a body of nigh seven
      thousand men. It was a torrent no force could stem. The tide of victory
      was with us; and we swept along, wave after wave, the infantry advancing
      in line for miles at either side, while whole brigades of artillery kept
      up a murderous fire without ceasing. Entire columns of the enemy
      surrendered as prisoners; guns were captured at each instant; and only by
      a miracle did the Grand-Duke escape our hussars, who followed him till he
      was lost to view in the flying ranks of the allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we gained the crest of the hill, we were in time to see Soult's
      victorious columns driving the enemy before them; while the Imperial
      Guard, up to that moment unengaged, reinforced the grenadiers on the
      right, and broke through the Russians on every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attempt to outflank us on the right we had perfectly retorted on the
      left; where Lannes's division, overlapping the line, pressed them on two
      sides, and drove them back, still fighting, into the plain, which, with a
      lake, separated the allied armies from the village of Austerlitz. And here
      took place the most dreadful occurrence of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two roads which led through the lake were soon so encumbered and
      blocked up by ammunition wagons and carts that they became impassable; and
      as the masses of the fugitives thickened, they spread over the lake, which
      happened to be frozen. It was at this time that the Emperor came up, and
      seeing the cavalry halted, and no longer in pursuit of the flying columns,
      ordered up twelve pieces of the artillery of the Imperial Guard, which,
      from the crest of the hill, opened a murderous fire on them. The slaughter
      was fearful as the discharges of grape and round shot cut channels through
      the jammed-up mass, and tore the dense columns, as it were, into
      fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreadful as the scene was, what followed far exceeded it in horror; for
      soon the shells began to explode beneath the ice, which now, with a
      succession of reports louder than thunder, gave way. In an instant whole
      regiments were ingulfed, and amid the wildest cries of despair, thousands
      sank never to appear again, while the deafening artillery mercilessly
      played upon them, till over that broad surface no living thing was seen to
      move, while beneath was the sepulchre of five thousand men. About seven
      thousand reached Austerlitz by another road to the northward; but even
      these had not escaped, save for a mistake of Bernadotte, who most
      unaccountably, as it was said, halted his division on the heights. Had it
      not been for this, not a soldier of the Russian right wing had been saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reserve cavalry and the dragoons of the Guard were now called up from
      the pursuit, and I saw my own regiment pass close by me, as I stood amid
      the staff round Murat. The men were fresh and eager for the fray; yet how
      many fell in that pursuit, even after the victory! The Russian batteries
      continued their fire to the last. The cannoneers were cut down beside
      their guns, and the cavalry made repeated charges on our advancing
      squadrons; nor was it till late in the day they fell back, leaving two
      thirds of their force dead or wounded on the field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      On every side now were to be seen the flying columns of the allies, hotly
      followed by the victorious French. The guns still thundered at intervals;
      but the loud roar of battle was subdued to the crashing din of charging
      squadrons, and the distant cries of the vanquishers and the vanquished.
      Around and about lay the wounded in all the fearful attitudes of
      suffering; and as we were fully a league in advance of our original
      position, no succor had yet arrived for the poor fellows whose courage had
      carried them into the very squares of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the staff&mdash;myself among the number&mdash;were despatched to
      the rear for assistance. I remember, as I rode along at my fastest speed,
      between the columns of infantry and the fragments of artillery which
      covered the grounds, that a <i>peloton</i> of dragoons came thundering
      past, while a voice shouted out &ldquo;Place! place!&rdquo; Supposing it was the
      Emperor himself, I drew up to one side, and uncovering my head, sat in
      patience till he had passed, when, with the speed of four horses urged to
      their utmost, a calèche flew by, two men dressed like couriers seated on
      the box. They made for the highroad towards Vienna, and soon disappeared
      in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can it mean?&rdquo; said I, to an officer beside me; &ldquo;not his Majesty,
      surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied he, smiling: &ldquo;it is General Lebrun on his way to Paris
      with the news of the victory. The Emperor is down at Reygern yonder, where
      he has just written the bulletin. I warrant you he follows that calèche
      with his eye; he'd rather see a battery of guns carried off by the enemy
      than an axle break there this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus closed the great day of Austerlitz&mdash;a hundred cannons,
      forty-three thousand prisoners, and thirty-two colors being the spoils of
      this the greatest of even Napoleon's victories.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE FIELD AT MIDNIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We passed the night on the field of battle,&mdash;a night dark and
      starless. The heavens were, indeed, clothed with black, and a heavy
      atmosphere, lowering and gloomy, spread like a pall over the dead and the
      dying. Not a breath of air moved; and the groans of the wounded sighed
      through the stillness with a melancholy cadence no words can convey. Far
      away in the distance the moving lights marked where fatigue parties went
      in search of their comrades. The Emperor himself did not leave the saddle
      till nigh morning; he went, followed by an ambulance, hither and thither
      over the plain, recalling the names of the several regiments, enumerating
      their deeds of prowess, and even asking for many of the soldiers by name.
      He ordered large fires to be lighted throughout the field, and where
      medical assistance could not be procured, the officers of the staff might
      be seen covering the wounded with greatcoats and cloaks, and rendering
      them such aid as lay in their power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreadful as the picture was,&mdash;fearful reverse to the gorgeous
      splendor of the vast army the morning sun had shone upon, and in the pride
      of strength and spirit,&mdash;yet even here was there much to make one
      feel that war is not bereft of its humanizing influences. How many a
      soldier did I see that night, blackened with powder, his clothes torn and
      ragged with shot, sitting beside a wounded comrade&mdash;now wetting his
      lips with a cool draught, now cheering his heart with words of comfort!
      Many, though wounded, were tending others less able to assist themselves.
      Acts of kindness and self-devotion&mdash;not less in number than those of
      heroism and courage&mdash;were met with at every step; while among the
      sufferers there lived a spirit of enthusiasm that seemed to lighten the
      worst pang of their agony. Many would cry out, as I passed, to know the
      fate of the day, and what became of this regiment or of that battalion.
      Others could but articulate a faint &ldquo;Vive l'Empereur!&rdquo; which in the
      intervals of pain they kept repeating, as though it were a charm against
      suffering; while one question met me every instant,&mdash;&ldquo;What says the
      Petit Caporal? Is he content with us?&rdquo; None were insensible to the
      glorious issue of that day; nor amid all the agony of death, dealt out in
      every shape of horror and misery, did I hear one word of anger or rebuke
      to him for whose ambition they had shed their heart's blood.

    </div>
    <p>
      Having secured a fresh horse, I rode forward in the direction of
      Austerlitz, where our cavalry, met by the chevaliers of the Russian
      Imperial Guard, sustained the greatest check and the most considerable
      loss of the day. The old dragoon who accompanied me warned me I should
      find few, if any, of our comrades living there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ventrebleu!</i> lieutenant, you can't expect it. The first four
      squadrons went down like one man; for when our fellows fell wounded from
      their horses, they always sabred or shot them as they lay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found this information but too correct. Lines of dead men lay beside
      their horses, ranged as they stood in battle, while before them lay the
      bodies of the Russian Guard, their gorgeous uniform all slashed with gold,
      marking them out amid the dull russet costumes of their comrades. In many
      places were they intermingled, and showed where a hand-to-hand combat had
      been fought; and I saw two clasped rigidly in each other's grasp, who had
      evidently been shot by others while struggling for the mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, mon lieutenant, it was useless to come here; this was <i>à la
      mort</i> while it lasted; and if it had continued much longer in the same
      fashion, it's hard to say which of us had been going over the field now
      with lanterns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Too true, indeed! Not one wounded man did we meet with, nor did one human
      voice break the silence around us. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they may have
      already carried up the wounded to the village yonder; I see a great blaze
      of light there. Bide forward, and learn if it be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I had dismissed the orderly, I dismounted from my horse, and walked
      carefully along the ridge of ground, anxious to ascertain if any poor
      fellow still remained alive amid that dreadful heap of dead. A low
      brushwood covered the ground in certain places; and here I perceived but
      few of the cavalry had penetrated, while the infantry were all tirailleurs
      of the Russian Guard, bayoneted by our advancing columns. As I approached
      the lake the ground became more rugged and uneven; and I was about to turn
      back, when my eye caught the faint glimmering of a light reflected in the
      water. Picketing my horse where he stood, I advanced alone towards the
      light, which I saw now was at the foot of a little rocky crag beside the
      lake. As I drew near, I stopped to listen, and could distinctly hear the
      deep tones of a man's voice, as if broken at intervals by pain, while in
      his accents I thought I could trace a tone of indignant passion rather
      than of bodily suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me, leave me where I am,&rdquo; cried he, peevishly. &ldquo;I thought I might
      have had my last few moments tranquil, when I staggered thus far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Comrade!&rdquo; said another, in a voice of comforting; &ldquo;come, thou
      wert never faint-hearted before. Thou hast had thy share of bruises, and
      cared little about them too. Art dry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; give me another drink. Ah!&rdquo; cried he, in an excited tone, &ldquo;they
      can't stand before the cuirassiers of the Guard. <i>Sacrebleu!</i> how
      proud the Petit Caporal will be of this day!&rdquo; Then, dropping his voice, he
      muttered, &ldquo;What care I who's proud? I have my billet, and must be going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, <i>mon enfant</i>; thou'lt have the cross for thy day's work. He
      knows thee well; I saw him smile to-day when thou madest the salute in
      passing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didst thou that?&rdquo; said the wounded man, with eagerness; &ldquo;did he smile?
      Ah, villain! how you can allure men to shed their heart's blood by a
      smile! He knows me! That he ought, and, if he but knew how I lay here now,
      he 'd send the best surgeon of his staff to look after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he would, and that he will; courage, and cheer up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I don't care for it now. I'll never go back to the regiment
      again; I could n't do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the last words his voice became fainter and fainter, and at
      last was lost in a hiccup; partly, as it seemed, from emotion, and partly
      from bodily suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Qui vive?</i>&rdquo; cried his companion, as the clash of my sabre announced
      my approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An officer of the Eighth Hussars,&rdquo; said I, in a low voice, fearing to
      disturb the wounded man, as he lay with his head sunk on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late, Comrade! too late,&rdquo; said he, in a stifled tone; &ldquo;the order of
      route has come. I must away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brave cuirassier of the Guard should never say so while he has a chance
      left to serve his Emperor in another field of battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vive l'Empereur! vive l'Empereur!&rdquo; shouted he, madly, as he lifted his
      helmet and tried to wave it above his head. But the exertion brought on a
      violent fit of coughing, which choked his utterance, while a torrent of
      red blood gushed from his mouth, and deluged his neck and chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>mon Dieu!</i> that cry has been his death,&rdquo; said the other,
      wringing his hands in utter misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he wounded?&rdquo; said I, kneeling down beside the sick man, who now
      lay, half on his face, upon the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the chest, through the lung,&rdquo; whispered the other. &ldquo;He doesn't know
      the doctor saw him; it was he told me there was no hope. 'You may leave
      him,' said he; 'an hour or two more are all that 's left him;' as if I
      could leave a comrade we all loved. My poor fellow, it is a sad day for
      the old Fourth when thou art taken from them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! was he of the Fourth, then?&rdquo; said I, remembering the regiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>parbleu!</i> and though but a corporal, he was well known
      throughout the army. Pioche&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pioche!&rdquo; cried I, in agony; &ldquo;is this Pioche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the wounded man, hearing the name, and answering as if on
      parade,&mdash;&ldquo;here, mon commandant! but too faint, I 'm afraid, for duty.
      I feel weak to-day,&rdquo; said he, as he pressed his hand upon his side, and
      then slowly sank back against the rock, and dropped his arms at either
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we must lose no time. Let us carry him to the rear. If
      nothing else can be done, he 'll meet with care&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! mon lieutenant! don't let him hear you speak of that. He stormed
      and swore so much when the ambulance passed, and they wanted to bring him
      along, that it brought on a coughing fit, just like what you saw, and he
      lay in a faint for half an hour after. He vows he 'll never stir from
      where he is. Truth is, Commandant,&rdquo; said he, in the lowest whisper, &ldquo;he is
      determined to die. When his squadron fell back from the Russian square, he
      rode on their bayonets, and cut at the men while the artillery was playing
      all about him. He told me this morning he 'd never leave the field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow! what was the meaning of this sad resolution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> a mere trifle, after all,&rdquo; said the other, shrugging his
      shoulders, and making a true French grimace of contempt. &ldquo;You 'll smile
      when I tell you; but he takes it to heart, poor fellow. His mistress has
      been false to him,&mdash;no great matter that, you 'd say,&mdash;but so it
      is, and nothing more. See how still he lies now! is he sleeping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not; he looks exhausted from loss of blood. Come, we must have him
      out of this; here comes my orderly to assist us. If we carry him to the
      road I 'll find a carriage of some sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said this in a tone of command, to silence any scruples he might still
      have about obeying his comrade in preference to the orders of an officer.
      He obeyed with the instinct of discipline, and proceeded to fold his cloak
      in such a manner that we could carry the wounded man between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor corporal, too weak to resist us, faint from bleeding and
      semi-stupid, suffered himself to be lifted upon the cloak, and never
      uttered a word or a cry as we bore him along between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not proceeded far when we came up with a convoy, conducting several
      carts with the wounded to the convent of Reygern, which had now been
      fitted up as an hospital. On one of these we secured a place for our poor
      friend, and walked along beside him towards the convent. As we went along
      I questioned his comrade closely on the point; and he told me that Pioche
      had resolved never to survive the battle, and had taken leave of his
      friends the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>parbleu!</i>&rdquo; added he, with energy, &ldquo;mademoiselle is pretty
      enough,&mdash;there 's no denying that; but her head is turned by flattery
      and soft speeches. All the gay young fellows of the hussar regiment, the
      aides-de-camp,&mdash;ay, and some of the generals, too,&mdash;have paid
      her so much attention that it could not be expected she'd care for a poor
      corporal. Not but that Pioche is a brave fellow and a fine soldier. <i>Sapristi!</i>
      he 'd be no discredit to any girl's choice. But Minette&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minette, the vivandière?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, to be sure, mon lieutenant; I'd warrant you must have known her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of her? where is she?&rdquo; said I, burning with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's with the wounded, up at Reygern yonder. They sent for her to
      Heilbrunn yesterday, where she was with the reserve battalions. <i>Ma foi!</i>
      you don't think our fellows would do without Minette at the ambulance,
      where there was a battle to be fought. They say they'd hard work enough to
      make her come up. After all, she's a strange girl; that she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that? Has she taken offence with the Fourth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that is not it; she likes the old regiment in her heart. I'd never
      believe she didn't; but&rdquo; (here he dropped his voice to a low whisper, as
      if dreading to be overheard by the wounded man), &ldquo;but they say&mdash;who
      knows if it's true?&mdash;that when she was left behind at Ulm or
      Elchingen, or somewhere up there on the Danube, that there was a young
      fellow&mdash;I heard his name, too, but I forget it&mdash;who was brought
      in badly wounded, and that mademoiselle was left to watch and nurse him.
      He got well in time, for the thing was not so serious as they thought. And
      what do you think was the return he made the poor girl? He seduced her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's false! false as hell!&rdquo; cried I, bursting with passion. &ldquo;Who has
      dared to spread such a calumny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be angry, mon lieutenant; there are plenty to answer for the
      report. And if it was yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it was by <i>my</i> bedside she watched; it was to <i>me</i> she
      gave that care and kindness by which I recovered from a dangerous wound.
      But so far from this base requital&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did she leave you, then, and march night and day with the chasseur
      brigade into the Tyrol? Why did she tell her friends that she'd never see
      the old Fourth again? Why did she fret herself into an illness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she do this, poor girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that she did. But, mayhap, you never heard of all this. I can only
      say, mon lieutenant, that you'd be safer in a broken square, charged by a
      heavy squadron, than among the Fourth, after what you 've done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned indignantly from him without a reply; for while my pride revolted
      at answering an accusation from such a quarter, my mind was harassed by
      the sad fate of poor Minette, and perplexed how to account for her sudden
      departure. My silence at once arrested my companion's speech, and we
      walked along the remainder of the way without a word on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was just breaking when the first wagon of the convoy entered the
      gates of the convent. It was an enormous mass of building, originally
      destined for the reception of about three thousand persons; for, in
      addition to the priestly inhabitants, there were two great hospitals and
      several schools included within the walls. This, before the battle, had
      been tenanted by the staffs of many general officers and the corps of
      engineers and sappers, but now was entirely devoted to the wounded of
      either army; for Austrians and Russians were everywhere to be met with,
      receiving equal care and attention with our own troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time I had witnessed a military hospital after a battle,
      and the impression was too fearful to be ever forgotten by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great chambers and spacious rooms of the convent were soon found
      inadequate for the numbers who arrived; and already the long corridors and
      passages of the building were crowded with beds, between which a narrow
      path scarcely permitted one person to pass. Here, promiscuously, without
      regard to rank, officers in command lay side by side with the meanest
      privates, awaiting the turn of medical aid, as no other order was observed
      than the necessities of each case demanded. A black mark above the bed,
      indicating that the patient's state was hopeless, proclaimed that no
      further attention need be bestowed; while the same mark, with a white bar
      across it, implied that it was a case for operation. In this way the
      surgeons who arrived at each moment from different corps of the army
      discovered, at a glance, where their services were required, and not a
      minute's time was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dreadful operations of surgery&mdash;for which, in the events of
      every-day life, every provision of delicate secrecy, and every minute
      detail which can alleviate dread, are so rigidly studied,&mdash;were here
      going forward on every side; the horrible preparations moved from bed to
      bed with a rapidity which showed that where suffering so abounded there
      was no time for sympathy; and the surgeons, with arms bare to the shoulder
      and bedaubed with blood, toiled away as though life no longer moved in the
      creeping flesh beneath the knife, and human agony spoke not aloud with
      every motion of their hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Place there! move forward!&rdquo; said an hospital surgeon, as they carried up
      the litter on which Pioche lay stretched and senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; cried a surgeon, leaning forward, and placing his hand on
      the sick man's pulse. &ldquo;Ah! take him back again; it 's all over there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried I, in agony, &ldquo;it can scarcely be; they lifted him alive
      from the wagon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not dead, sir,&rdquo; replied the surgeon, in a whisper, &ldquo;but he will soon
      be; there's internal bleeding going on from that wound, and a few hours,
      or less perhaps must close the scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can nothing be done? nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not.&rdquo; He opened the jacket of the wounded man as he spoke, and
      slitting the inner clothes asunder with a quick stroke of his scissors,
      disclosed a tremendous sabre-wound in the side. &ldquo;That is not the worst,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; pointing to a small bluish mark of a bullet hole
      above it; &ldquo;here lies the mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hospital aid whispered something at the instant in the surgeon's ear,
      to which he quickly replied, &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This instant, sir; the ligature slipped, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remove him,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Now, sir, I have a bed for your poor fellow
      here; but I have little hope to give you. His pulse is stronger, otherwise
      the endeavor would be lost time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they carried the litter forward, I perceived that another party were
      lifting from a bed near a figure, over whose face the sheet was carelessly
      thrown. I guessed from the gestures that the form they lifted was
      lifeless; the heavy sumph of the body upon the ground showed it beyond a
      doubt. The bearers replaced the dead man by the dying body of poor Pioche;
      and from a vague feeling of curiosity, I stooped down and drew back the
      sheet from the face of the corpse. As I did so, my limbs trembled, and I
      leaned back almost fainting against the wall. Pale with the pallor of
      death, but scarcely altered from life, I beheld the dead features of
      Amédée Pichot, the captain whose insolence had left an unsettled quarrel
      between us. The man for whose coming I waited to expiate an open insult,
      now lay cold and lifeless at my feet. What a rush of sensations passed
      through my mind as I gazed on that motionless mass! and oh, what gratitude
      my heart gushed to think that he did not fall by <i>my</i> hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brave soldier, but a quarrelsome friend,&rdquo; said the surgeon, stooping
      down to examine the wound, with all the indifference of a man who regarded
      life as a mere problem. &ldquo;It was a cannon-shot carried it off.&rdquo; As he said
      this, he disclosed the mangled remains of a limb, torn from the trunk too
      high to permit of amputation. &ldquo;Poor Amédée! it was the death he always
      wished for. It was a strange horror he had of falling by the hand of an
      adversary, rather than being carried off thus. And now for the
      cuirassier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he turned towards the bed on which Pioche lav, still as death
      itself. A few minutes' careful investigation of the case enabled him to
      pronounce that although the chances were many against recovery, yet it was
      not altogether hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All will depend on the care of whoever watches him,&rdquo; said the surgeon.
      &ldquo;Symptoms will arise, requiring prompt attention and a change in
      treatment; and this is one of those cases where a nurse is worth a hundred
      doctors. Who takes charge of this bed?&rdquo; he called aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minette, Monsieur,&rdquo; said a sergeant. &ldquo;She has lain down to take a little
      rest, for she was quite worn out with fatigue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me voici!&rdquo; said a silvery voice I knew at once to be hers. And the same
      instant she pierced the crowd around the bed, and approached the patient.
      No sooner had she beheld the features of the sick man than she reeled
      back, and grasped the arms of the persons on either side. For a few
      seconds she stood, with her hands pressed upon her face, and when she
      withdrew them, her features were almost ghastly in their hue, while, with
      a great effort over her emotion, she said, in a low voice, &ldquo;Can he
      recover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Minette!&rdquo; replied the surgeon, &ldquo;and will, if care avail anything.
      Just hear me for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he drew her to one side, and commenced to explain the treatment
      he proposed to adopt. As he spoke, her cloak, which up to this instant she
      wore, dropped from her shoulders, and she stood there in the dress of the
      vivandière: a short frock coat, of light blue, with a thin gold braid upon
      the collar and the sleeve; loose trousers of white jean, strapped beneath
      her boots; a silk sash of scarlet and gold entwined was fastened round her
      waist, and fell in a long fringe at her side; while a cap of blue cloth,
      with a gold band and tassel, hung by a hook at her girdle. Simple as was
      the dress, it displayed to perfection the symmetry of her figure and her
      carriage, and suited the character of her air and gesture, which, abrupt
      and impatient at times, was almost boyish in the wayward freedom of her
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon soon finished his directions, the crowd separated, and Minette
      alone remained by the sick man's bed. For some minutes her cares did not
      permit her to look up; but when she did, a slight cry broke from her, and
      she sank down upon the seat at the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minette, dear Minette, you are not angry with me?&rdquo; said I, in a low and
      trembling tone. &ldquo;I have not done aught to displease you,&mdash;have I so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered not a word, but a blush of the deepest scarlet suffused her
      face and temples, and her bosom heaved almost convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you I owe my life,&rdquo; continued I, with earnestness; &ldquo;nay more, I owe
      the kindness which made of a sick-bed a place of pleasant thoughts and
      happy memories. Can I, then, have offended you, while my whole heart was
      bursting with gratitude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A paleness, more striking than the blush that preceded it, now stole over
      her features, but she uttered not a word. Her eyes turned from me and fell
      upon her own figure, and I saw the tears till up and roll slowly along her
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you leave me, Minette?&rdquo; said I, wound up by her obstinate silence
      beyond further endurance. &ldquo;Did the few words of impatience&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; broke she in, &ldquo;not that! not that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then? Tell me, for Heaven's sake, how have I earned your
      displeasure? Believe me, I have met with too little kindness in my way
      through life, not to feel poignantly the loss of a friend. What was it, I
      beseech you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do not ask me!&rdquo; cried she, with streaming eyes; &ldquo;do not, I beg of
      you. Enough that you know&mdash;and this I swear to you,&mdash;that no
      fault of yours was in question. You were always good and always kind to
      me,&mdash;too kind, too good,&mdash;but not even your teaching could alter
      the waywardness of my nature. Speak of this no more, I ask you, as the
      greatest favor you can bestow on me. See here,&rdquo; cried she, while her lips
      trembled with emotion; &ldquo;I have need of all my courage to be of use to him;
      and you will not, I am sure, render me unequal to my task.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are friends, Minette; friends as before,&rdquo; said I, taking her hand,
      and pressing it within mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, friends!&rdquo; muttered she, in a broken voice, while she turned her head
      from me. &ldquo;Adieu! Monsieur, adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, then, since you wish it so, Minette! But whatever your secret
      reason for this change towards me, you never can alter the deep-rooted
      feeling of my heart, which makes me know myself your friend forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The more I thought of Minette's conduct, the more puzzled I was. No
      jealousy on the part of Pioche could explain her abrupt departure from
      Elchingen, and her resolve never to rejoin the Fourth. She was, indeed, a
      strange girl, wayward and self-willed; but her impulses all had their
      source in high feelings of honor and exalted pride. It might have been
      that some chance expression had given her offence; yet she denied this.
      But still, her former frankness was gone, and a sense of coldness, if not
      distrust, had usurped its place. I could make nothing of it. One thing
      alone did I feel convinced of,&mdash;she did not love Pioche. Poor fellow!
      with all the fine traits of his honest nature, the manly simplicity and
      openness of his character, he had not those arts of pleasing which win
      their way with a woman's mind. Besides that, Minette, from habit and tone
      of voice, had imbibed feelings and ideas of a very different class in
      society, and with a feminine tact, had contrived to form acquaintance
      with, and a relish for, the tastes and pleasures of the cultivated World.
      The total subversion of all social order effected by the Revolution had
      opened the path of ambition in life equally to women as to men; and all
      the endeavors of the Consulate and the Empire had not sobered down the
      minds of France to their former condition. The sergeant to-day saw no
      reason why he might not wear his epaulettes to-morrow, and in time
      exchange his shako even for a crown; and so the vivandière, whose life was
      passed in the intoxicating atmosphere of glory, might well dream of
      greatness which should be hers hereafter, and of the time when, as the
      wife of a marshal or a peer of France, she would walk the <i>salons</i> of
      the Tuileries as proudly as the daughter of a Rohan or a Tavanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, then, nothing vain or presumptuous in the boldest flight of
      ambition. However glittering the goal, it was beyond the reach of none;
      and the hopes which, in better-ordered communities, had been deemed
      absurd, seemed here but fair and reasonable. And from this element alone
      proceeded some of the greatest actions, and by far the greatest portion of
      the unhappiness, of the period. The mind of the nation was unfixed; men
      had not as yet resolved themselves into those grades and classes, by the
      means of which public opinion is brought to bear upon individuals from
      those of his own condition. Each was a law unto himself, suggesting his
      own means of advancement and estimating his own powers of success; and the
      result was, a general scramble for rank, dignity, and honors, the
      unfitness of the possessor for which, when attained, brought neither
      contempt nor derision. The epaulette was noblesse; the shako, a coronet.
      What wonder, then, if she, whose personal attractions were so great, and
      whose manners and tone of thought were so much above her condition, had
      felt the stirrings of that ambition within her heart which now appeared to
      be the moving spirit of the nation!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost in such thoughts, I turned homewards towards my quarters, and was
      already some distance from the convent when a dragoon galloped up to my
      side, and asked eagerly if I were the surgeon of the Sixth Grenadiers. As
      I replied in the negative, he muttered something between his teeth, and
      added louder, &ldquo;The poor general; it will be too late after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and before I could question him further, he set spurs to his
      horse, and dashing onwards, soon disappeared in the darkness of the night.
      A few minutes afterwards I beheld a number of lanterns straight before me
      on the narrow road, and as I came nearer, a sentinel called out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt there! stand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave my name and rank, when the man, advancing towards me, said in a
      half whisper,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our general, sir; they say he cannot be brought any farther, and
      they must perform the operation here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier's voice trembled at every word, and he could scarcely falter
      out, in reply to my question, the name of the wounded officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General St. Hilaire, sir, who led the grenadiers on the Pratzen,&rdquo; said
      the poor fellow, his sorrow struggling with his pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pressed forward; and there on a litter lay the figure of a large and
      singularly fine-looking man. His coat, which was covered with orders, lay
      open, and discovered a shirt stained and clotted with blood; but his most
      dangerous wound was from a grapeshot in the thigh, which shattered the
      bone, and necessitated amputation. A young staff surgeon, the only medical
      man present, was kneeling at his side, and occupied in compressing some
      wounded vessels to arrest the bleeding, which, at the slightest stir of
      the patient, broke out anew. The remainder of the group were grenadiers of
      his own regiment, in whose sad and sorrow-struck faces one might read the
      affection his men invariably bore him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he coming? can you hear any one coming?&rdquo; said the young surgeon, in an
      anxious whisper to the soldier beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; but he cannot be far off now,&rdquo; replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I ride back to Reygern for assistance?&rdquo; said I, in a low voice, to
      the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the wounded man, in a low, calm tone,&mdash;for
      with the quick ear of suffering he had overheard my question,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      thank you, but my orderly has already been sent thither. If you could
      relieve my young friend here from his fatiguing duty for a little, you
      would render us both a service. I am truly grieved to see him so much
      exhausted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, sir!&rdquo; stammered the youth, as the tears ran fast down his cheeks;
      &ldquo;this is my place. I will not leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind fellow!&rdquo; muttered the general, as he pressed his hand gently on the
      young man's arm; &ldquo;I can bear this better than you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here he comes now,&rdquo; said the sentinel; and the same moment a man
      dismounted from his horse, and came forward towards us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Louis, the surgeon of the Emperor himself, despatched by Napoleon
      the moment he heard of the event. At any other moment, perhaps, the abrupt
      demeanor of this celebrated surgeon would have savored little of delicacy
      or feeling; nor even then could I forgive the sudden announcement in which
      he conveyed to the sufferer that immediate amputation must be performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No chance left but this, Louis?&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, sir,&rdquo; replied the doctor, while he unlocked an instrument case, and
      busied himself in preparation for the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you defer it a little; an hour or two, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour, perhaps; not more, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But am I certain of your services then, Louis?&rdquo; said the general, trying
      to smile. &ldquo;You know I always promised myself your aid when this hour
      came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall return in an hour,&rdquo; replied the doctor, pulling out his watch; &ldquo;I
      am going to Rapp's quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Rapp! is he wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere sabre-cut; but Sebastiani has suffered more severely. Now then,
      Lanusse,&rdquo; said he, addressing the young surgeon, &ldquo;you remain here.
      Continue as you are doing, and in an hour&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour,&rdquo; echoed the wounded man, with a shudder, as though the
      anticipation of the dreadful event had thrilled through his very heart.
      Nor was it till the retiring sounds of the surgeon's horse had died away
      in the distance that his features recovered their former calm and tranquil
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prompt fellow is Louis,&rdquo; said he, after a pause; &ldquo;and though one might
      like somewhat more courtesy in the Faubourg, yet on the field of battle it
      is all for the best; this is no place nor time for compliments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man answered not a word, either not daring to criticise too
      harshly his superior, or perhaps his emotion at the moment was too strong
      for utterance. In reply to my offer to remain with him, however, he
      thanked me heartily, and seemed gratified that he was not to be left alone
      in such a trying emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said St. Hilaire, after a pause, &ldquo;I have asked for time, and am
      already forgetting how to employ it. Who can write here? Can you,
      Guilbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, no, sir!&rdquo; said a dark grenadier, blushing to the very eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will permit a stranger, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will be but too proud and
      too happy to render you any assistance in my power. I am on the staff of
      General d'Auvergne, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A French officer, sir,&rdquo; interrupted he; &ldquo;quite enough. I ask for no other
      guerdon of your honor. Sit down here, then, and&mdash;But first try if you
      can discover a pocket-book in my sabretache; I hope it has not been lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is, General,&rdquo; said a soldier, coming forward with it; &ldquo;I found it
      on the ground beside you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I will ask you to write down from my dictation a few lines,
      which, should this affair,&rdquo;&mdash;he faltered slightly here,&mdash;&ldquo;this
      affair prove unfortunate, you will undertake to convey, by some means or
      other, to the address I shall give you in Paris. It is not a will, I
      assure you,&rdquo; continued he with a faint smile. &ldquo;I have no wealth to leave;
      but I know his Majesty too well to fear anything on that score. But my
      children, I wish to give some few directions&mdash;&rdquo; Here he stopped for
      several minutes, and then, in a calm voice, added, &ldquo;Whenever you are
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with a suffering spirit and a faltering hand I wrote down, from his
      dictation, some short sentences addressed to each member of his family. Of
      these it is not my intention to speak, save in one instance, where St.
      Hilaire himself evinced a wish that his sentiments should not be a matter
      of secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire,&rdquo; said he, in a firm tone of voice, as he turned round and
      addressed the soldiers on either side of him,&mdash;&ldquo;I desire that my son,
      now at the Polytechnique, should serve the Emperor better than, and as
      faithfully as, his father has done, if his Majesty will graciously permit
      him to do so, in the grenadier battalion, which I have long commanded; it
      will be the greatest favor I can ask of him.&rdquo; A low murmur of grief, no
      longer repressible, ran through the little group around the litter. &ldquo;The
      grenadiers of the Sixth,&rdquo; continued he, proudly, while for an instant his
      pale features flushed up, &ldquo;will not love him the less for the name he
      bears. Come, come, men! do not give way thus; what will my kind young
      friend here say of us, when he joins the hussar brigade? This is not their
      ordinary mood, believe me,&rdquo; said he, addressing me. &ldquo;The Russian Guard
      would give a very different account of them; they are stouter fellows at
      the <i>pas dé charge</i> than around the litter of a wounded comrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was yet speaking, Louis returned, followed by two officers, one
      of whom, notwithstanding his efforts at concealment, I recognized to be
      Marshal Murat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must remove him, if it be possible,&rdquo; said the surgeon, in a whisper.
      &ldquo;And yet the slightest motion is to be dreaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I speak to him?&rdquo; said Murat, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that you may,&rdquo; replied Louis, who now pushed his way forward and
      approached the litter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, so soon!&rdquo; said the wounded man, looking up; &ldquo;a man of your word,
      Louis. And how is Rapp? Nothing in this fashion, I hope,&rdquo; added he,
      pointing to his fractured limb with a sickly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the surgeon. &ldquo;But here is Marshal Murat come to inquire
      after you, from the Emperor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush of pride lit up St. Hilaire's features as he heard this, and he
      asked eagerly, &ldquo;Where, where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must remove you, St. Hilaire,&rdquo; said Murat, endeavoring to speak
      calmly, when it was evident his feelings were highly excited; &ldquo;Louis says
      you must not remain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like, Marshal. What says his Majesty? Is the affair as decisive as
      he looked for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far more so. The allied army is destroyed; the campaign is ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then, this is not so bad as I deemed it,&rdquo; rejoined St. Hilaire,
      with a tone of almost gayety; &ldquo;I can afford to be invalided if the Emperor
      has no further occasion for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While these few words were interchanging, Louis had applied a tourniquet
      around the wounded limb, and having given the soldiers directions how they
      were to step, so as not to disturb or displace the shattered bones, he
      took his place beside the litter, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are ready now, General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They lifted the litter as he spoke, and moved slowly forward. Murat
      pressed the hand St. Hilaire extended to him without a word; and then,
      turning his head away, suffered the party to pass on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we reached Beygern, the wounded general had fallen into a heavy
      sleep, from which he did not awake as they laid him on the bed in the
      hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, sir,&mdash;or rather, good-morning,&rdquo; said Louis to me, as I
      turned to leave the spot. &ldquo;We may chance to have better news for you than
      we anticipated, when you visit us here again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so we parted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. A MAÎTRE D'ARMES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after the battle of Austerlitz the Prince of Lichtenstein arrived
      in our camp, with, as it was rumored, proposals for a peace. The
      negotiations, whatever they were, were strictly secret, not even the
      marshals themselves being admitted to Napoleon's confidence on this
      occasion. Soon after mid-day, a great body of the Guard who had been in
      reserve the previous day were drawn up in order of battle, presenting an
      array of several thousand men, whose dress, look, and equipment, fresh as
      if on parade before the Tuileries, could not fail to strike the Austrian
      envoy with amazement. Everything that could indicate the appearance of
      suffering, or even fatigue, among the troops, was sedulously kept out of
      view. Such of the cavalry regiments as suffered least in the battle were
      under arms; while the generals of division received orders to have their
      respective staffs fully equipped and mounted, as if on a day of review.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon when the word was passed along the lines to
      stand to arms; and the moment after a <i>calèche</i>, drawn by six horses,
      passed in full gallop, and took the road towards Austerlitz. The return of
      the Austrian envoy set a thousand conjectures in motion, and all were
      eager to find out what had been the result of his mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must soon learn it all,&rdquo; said an old colonel of artillery near me. &ldquo;If
      the game be war, we shall be called up to assist Davoust's movement on
      Göding. The Russians have but one line of retreat, and that is already in
      our possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot for the life of me understand the Emperor's inaction,&rdquo; said a
      younger officer; &ldquo;here we remain just as if nothing had been done. One
      would suppose that a Russian army stood in full force before us, and that
      we had not gained a tremendous battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend on it, Auguste,&rdquo; said the old officer, smiling, &ldquo;his Majesty is
      not the man to let slip his golden opportunities. If we don't advance, it
      is because it is safer to remain where we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safer than pursue a flying enemy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so. It is not Russia, nor Austria, we have in the field against us;
      but Europe,&mdash;the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; retorted the other, boldly; &ldquo;nor do I think the odds
      unfair. All I would ask is, the General Bonaparte of Cairo or Marengo, and
      not the purple-clad Emperor of the Tuileries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not while the plain is yet reeking with the blood of Austerlitz
      that such a reproach should be spoken,&rdquo; said I, indignantly. &ldquo;Never was
      Bonaparte greater than Napoleon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur has served in Egypt?&rdquo; said the young man, contemptuously, while
      he measured me from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that I had! Would that I could give whatever years I may have
      before me, for those whose every day shall live in history!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, young man,&rdquo; said the old colonel; &ldquo;they were glorious
      times, and a worthy prelude to the greatness that followed them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bright promise of the future,&mdash;never to come,&rdquo; rejoined the
      younger, with a flash of anger on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu</i>, sir, you speak boldly!&rdquo; said a harsh, low voice from
      behind. We turned: it was Napoleon, dressed in a gray coat, all covered
      with fur, and looking like one of the couriers of the army. &ldquo;I did not
      know my measures were so freely canvassed as I find them. Who are you,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legrange, Sire, chef d'escadron of the Second Voltigeurs,&rdquo; said the young
      man, trembling from head to foot while he uncovered his head, and stood,
      cap in hand, before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when, sir, have I called you into my counsels and asked your
      advice? or what is it in your position which entitles you to question one
      in mine? Duroc, come here. Your sword, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man let fall his shako from his hand, and laid it on his
      sword-hilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the Emperor, suddenly; &ldquo;what became of your right arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left it at Aboukir, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Napoleon muttered something between his teeth; then added, aloud,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sir, you are not the first whose hand has saved his head. Return to
      your duty, and, mark me! be satisfied with doing yours, and leave me to
      mine. And you, sir,&rdquo; said he, turning towards me, and using the same harsh
      tone of voice, &ldquo;I should know your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lieutenant Burke, of the Eighth Hussars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I remember,&mdash;the Chouanist. So, sir, it seems that I stand
      somewhat higher in your esteem than when you kept company with Messieurs
      Georges and Pichegru, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sire; your Majesty ever occupied the first place in my admiration and
      devotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sacristi!</i> then you took a strange way to show it when first I had
      the pleasure of your acquaintance. You are on General St. Hilaire's
      staff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General d'Auvergne's, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. D'Auvergne, a word with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and whispered something to the old general, who during the whole
      colloquy stood at his back, anxious but not daring to interpose a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Napoleon, in a voice of much kinder accent, &ldquo;I am
      satisfied. Your general, sir, reports favorably of your zeal and capacity.
      I do not desire to let your former conduct prove any bar to your
      advancement; and on his recommendation, of which I trust you may prove
      yourself worthy, I name you to a troop in your own regiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And still to serve on my staff?&rdquo; said the general, half questioning the
      Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you wish it, D'Auvergne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he moved forward ere I could do more than express my gratitude
      by a respectful bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, Burke, the time would come for this,&rdquo; said D'Auvergne, as he
      pressed my hand warmly, and followed the cortege of the Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto I had lived an almost isolated life. My staff duties had so
      separated me from my brother officers that I only knew them by name; while
      the other aides-de-camp of the general were men much older than myself,
      and with none of them had I formed any intimacy whatever. It was not
      without a sense of this loneliness that I now thought over my promotion.
      The absence of those who sympathize with our moments of joy and sorrow
      reduces our enjoyment to a narrow limit indeed. The only one of all I knew
      who would really have felt happy in my advancement was poor Pioche. He was
      beyond every thought of pleasure or grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus reflecting, I turned towards my quarters at Brunn. It was evening:
      the watchfires were lighted, and round them sat groups of soldiers at
      their supper, chatting away pleasantly, and recounting the events of the
      battle. Many had been slightly wounded, and by their bandaged foreheads
      and disabled arms claimed a marked pre-eminence above the rest. A straw
      bivouac, with its great blazing fire in front, would denote some officer's
      quarters; and here were generally some eight or ten assembled, while the
      savory odor of some smoking dish, and the merry laughter, proclaimed that
      feasting was not excluded from the life of a campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I passed one of these I heard the tones of a voice which, well known,
      had somehow not been heard by me for many a day before. Who could it be? I
      listened, but in vain. I asked myself whose was it. I dismounted, and
      leading my horse by the bridle, passed before the hut. The strong light of
      the blazing wood lit up the interior, and showed me a party of about a
      dozen officers, seated and lying on a heap of straw, occupied in
      discussing a supper, which, however wanting in all the elegancies of table
      equipment, even where I stood had a most appetizing odor. Various drinking
      vessels, some of them silver, passed from hand to hand rapidly; and the
      clinking of cups proclaimed that, although of different regiments,&mdash;as
      I saw they were,&mdash;a kindly feeling united them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, François,&rdquo; said the same voice, whose accents were so familiar to
      me without my being able to say why,&mdash;&ldquo;well, Francois, you have not
      told us how it happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily enough,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;he broke my blade in his back, and gave
      point afterwards and ran me through the chest.&rdquo; It was the maître d'armes
      of the Fourth, my old antagonist, who said this, and I drew near to hear
      the remainder. &ldquo;You could not call the thing unfair,&rdquo; continued he; &ldquo;but,
      after all, no one ever heard of such a <i>passe</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have told you of it, though,&rdquo; rejoined the other; &ldquo;for I remember
      once, in the fencing school at the Polytechnique, I saw him catch his
      antagonist's blade in his sleeve, and when he had it secure, snap it
      across, and then thrust home with his own. <i>Parbleu!</i> he lost a coat
      by it; and I believe, at the time, poor fellow, he could ill spare it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This story, which was told of myself, was an incident which occurred in a
      school duel, and was only known to two or three others; and again was I
      puzzled to think which of my former companions the speaker could be. My
      curiosity was now stronger than aught else; and so, affecting to seek a
      light for my cigar, I approached the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo, Comrade! a cup of wine with you,&rdquo; cried out a voice from within;
      &ldquo;Melniker is no bad drinking&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Chambertin can't be had,&rdquo; said another, handing me a goblet of red
      wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Par Saint Denis!</i> it's the very man himself,&rdquo; shouted a third.
      &ldquo;Why, Burke, my old comrade, do you forget Tascher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said I, in amazement, turning from one to the other of the
      mustached faces, and unable to discover my former friend, while they
      laughed loud and long at my embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make way for him there; make way, lads! Come, Burke, here's your place,&rdquo;
       said he, stretching out his hand and pressing me down beside him on the
      straw. &ldquo;So you did not remember me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, there was enough of change in his appearance since last I saw
      him to warrant my forgetfulness. A dark, bushy beard, worn cuirassier
      fashion, around the mouth and high on the cheeks, almost concealed his
      face, while in figure he had grown both taller and stouter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art colonel of the Eighth Regiment?&rdquo; said he, laughing; &ldquo;you know I
      promised you were to be, when we were to meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but, if I mistake not,&rdquo; said a hussar officer opposite, &ldquo;monsieur is
      in the way to become so. Were you not named to a troop, about half an hour
      ago, by the Emperor himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said I, with an effort to suppress my pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Diantre bleu!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Tascher, &ldquo;what good fortune you always
      have I I wish you joy of it, with all my heart. I say, Comrades, let us
      drown his commission for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed! agreed!&rdquo; cried they all in a breath. &ldquo;Francois will make us a
      bowl of punch for the occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most willingly,&rdquo; said the little maître d'armes. &ldquo;Monsieur le Capitaine,
      I am sure, bears me no ill-will for our little affair. I thought not,&rdquo;
       added he, seizing my hand in both his. &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> you spoiled my
      tierce for me; I shall never be the same man again. Now, gentlemen, pass
      down the brandy, and let the man with most credit go seek for sugar at the
      canteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While François commenced his operations, Tascher proceeded to recount to
      me the miserable life he had spent in garrison towns, till the outbreak of
      the campaign had called him on active service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no use that I asked the Empress to intercede for me, and get me
      appointed to another regiment; being the nephew of Napoleon seemed to set
      a complete bar to my advancement. Even now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my name has been
      sent forward by my colonel for promotion, and I wager you fifty Naps I
      shall be passed over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if you be?&rdquo; said a huge, heavy-browed major beside him; &ldquo;what
      great hardship is it to be a lieutenant in the cuirassiers at two and
      twenty? I was a sergeant ten years later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, <i>parbleu!</i>&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;I won my epaulettes at Cairo, when
      three officers were reported living, in a whole regiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said François, looking up from his operation of
      lemon-squeezing; &ldquo;here am I, a maître d'armes, after twenty-six years'
      service; and there's Davoust, who never could stand before me, he's a
      general of brigade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole party laughed aloud at the grievances of Maître Francois, whose
      seriousness on the subject was perfectly real.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah; you may laugh,&rdquo; said he, half in pique; &ldquo;but what a mere accident can
      determine a man's fortune in life! Would Junot there be a major-general
      to-day if he did not measure six feet without his boots? We were at school
      together, and, <i>ma foi!</i> he was always at the bottom of the class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, Francois, it was your size, then, that stopped your promotion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was. When a man is but five feet&mdash;with high heels, too&mdash;he
      can only be advanced as a maître d'armes. <i>Parbleu!</i> what should I be
      now if I had only grown a little taller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all better as it is,&rdquo; growled out an old captain, between the puffs
      of his meerschaum. &ldquo;If thou wert an inch bigger, there would be' no living
      in the same brigade with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; rejoined Maître François, &ldquo;I have put many a pretty fellow
      his full length on the grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many duels, François, did you tell us, the other evening, that you
      fought in the Twenty-second?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy-eight!&rdquo; said the little man; &ldquo;not to speak of two affairs which,
      I am ashamed to confess, were with the broadsword; but they were fellows
      from Alsace, and they knew no better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tonnerre de ciel!</i>&rdquo; cried the major, &ldquo;a little devil like that is a
      perfect plague in a regiment. I remember we had a fellow called Piccotin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Piccotin; poor Piccotin! We were foster-brothers,&rdquo; interrupted
      Francois; &ldquo;we were both from Châlons-sur-Marne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad! I 'd have sworn you were,&rdquo; rejoined the major. &ldquo;One might have
      thought ye were twins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People often said so,&rdquo; responded François, with as much composure as
      though a compliment had been intended. &ldquo;We both had the same colored hair
      and eyes, the same military air, and gave the <i>passe en tierce</i>
      always outside the guard exactly in the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of Piccotin?&rdquo; asked the major. &ldquo;He left us at Lyons.&rdquo; &ldquo;You
      never heard, then, what became of him?&rdquo; &ldquo;No. We knew he joined the <i>chasseurs
      à pied</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can tell you, then,&rdquo; said Francois; &ldquo;no one knows better.
      I parted from Piccotin when we were ordered to Egypt. We did our best to
      obtain service in the same brigade, for we were like brothers, but we
      could not manage it; and so, with sad hearts, we separated,&mdash;he to
      return to France, I to sail for Alexandria. This was in the spring of
      1798, or, as we called it, the year Six of the Republic. For three years
      we never met; but when the eighth demi-brigade returned from Egypt, we
      went into garrison at Bayonne, and the first man I saw on the ramparts was
      Piccotin himself. There was no mistaking him; you know the way he had of
      walking with a long stride, rising on his instep at every step, squaring
      his elbows, and turning his head from side to side, just to see if any one
      was pleased to smile, or even so much as to look closely at him. Ah, <i>ma
      foi!</i> little Piccotin knew how to treat such as well as any one.
      Methinks I see him approaching his man with a slide and a bow, and then,
      taking off his cap, I hear him say, in his mildest tone, 'Monsieur
      assuredly did not intend that stare and that grimace for me. I know I must
      have deceived myself. Monsieur is only a fool; he never meant to be
      impertinent.' Then, <i>parbleu!</i> what a storm would come on, and how
      cool was Piccotin the whole time! How scrupulously timid he would be of
      misspelling the gentleman's name, or misplacing an accent over it! How
      delicately he would inquire his address, as if the curiosity was only
      pardonable I And then with what courtesy he would take his leave, retiring
      half a dozen paces before he ventured to turn his back on the man he was
      determined to kill next morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true; perfectly true, Francois,&rdquo; said the major; &ldquo;Piccotin did the
      thing with the most admirable temper and good-breeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the tone of Chalons when we were both boys,&rdquo; said François,
      proudly; &ldquo;he and I were reared together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He finished a bumper of wine as he made this satisfactory explanation, and
      looked round at the company with the air of a conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Piccotin saw me as quickly as I perceived him, and the minute after we
      were in each other's arms. 'Ah! <i>mon cher!</i> how many?' said he to me,
      as soon as the first burst of enthusiasm had subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Only eighteen,' said I, sadly; 'but two were Mamelukes of the Guard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Thou wert ever fortunate, François,' he replied, wiping his eyes with
      emotion; 'I have never pinked any but Christians.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come, come,' said I, 'don't be down-hearted; good times are coming. They
      say Le Petit Caporal will have us in England soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mayhap,' said he, sorrowfully, for he could not get over my Turks. Well,
      in order to cheer him up a little, I proposed that we should go and sup
      together at the 'Grenadier Rouge;' and away we went accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would amuse you, perhaps,&rdquo; said Maître François, &ldquo;were I to tell some
      of the stories we related to each other at night. We both had had our
      share of adventure since we met, and some droll ones among the number.
      However, that is not the question at present. We sat late; so late that
      they came to close the café at last, and we were obliged to depart. You
      know the 'Grenadier Rouge,' don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know it well,&rdquo; replied the major; &ldquo;it's over the glacis, about a
      mile outside the barrier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so; and there's a pleasant walk across the glacis to the gate. As
      Piccotin and I set out together on our way to the town, the night was calm
      and mild; a soft moonlight shed a silvery tint over every object, and left
      the stately poplars to throw a still longer shadow on the smooth grass.
      For some time we walked along without speaking; the silence of the night,
      the fragrant air, the mellow light, were all soft and tranquillizing
      influences, and we sank each into his own reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we reached the middle of the plain,&mdash;you know the spot, I'm
      sure; there's a little bronze fountain, with four cedars round it,&rdquo; (the
      major nodded, and he resumed),&mdash;&ldquo;Piccotin came to a sudden halt, and
      seizing my hand in both of his, said, 'François, canst thou guess what I
      'm thinking of?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looked at him, and I looked around me, and after a few seconds' pause I
      answered, 'Yes, Piccotin, I know it; it is a lovely spot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Never was anything like it!' cried he, in a rapture; 'look at the turf,
      smooth as velvet, and yet soft to the foot; see the trees, how they fall
      back to give the light admittance; and there, that little fountain, if one
      felt thirsty, eh! What say you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Agreed,' said I, grasping him by both hands; 'for this once; once only,
      Piccotin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Only once, François; a few passes, and no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Just so; the first touch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Exactly; the first touch,' said he, as, taking off his cloak, and
      folding it neatly, he laid it on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a strange thing, but in all our lives, from earliest boyhood up,
      we never had measured swords together; and though we were both maîtres
      d'armes, we never crossed blades, even in jest. Often and often had our
      comrades pitted us against each other, and laid wagers on the result, but
      we never would consent to meet; I cannot say why. It was not fear; I know
      not how to account for it, but such was the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What blade do you wear, François?' said he, approaching me, as I
      arranged my jacket and vest, with my cap, on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A Rouen steel,' said I; 'too limber for most men, but I am so accustomed
      to it, I prefer it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah! a pretty weapon indeed,' said he, drawing it from the scabbard, and
      making one or two passes with it against an elder trunk. 'Was this the
      blade you had with you in Egypt?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes; I have worn none other for eight years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah, <i>ma foi!</i> those Mamelukes. How I envy you those Mamelukes!' he
      muttered to himself, as he walked back to his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Move a little, a very little, to the left; there's a shadow from that
      tree. Can you see me well?' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Perfectly; are you ready? Well; <i>en garde!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Piccotin's forte, I soon saw, lay in the long meditated attack, where
      each movement was part of an artfully devised series; and I perceived that
      he suffered his adversary to gain several trifling advantages, by way of
      giving him a false confidence, biding his own time to play off the scores.
      In this description of fence he was more than my equal. <i>My</i> strength
      was in the skirmishing passages, where most men lunge at random; then, no
      matter how confused the rally, I was as cool as in the salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some time I permitted him to play his game out; and certainly nothing
      could be more beautiful than his passes over the hilt. Twice he planted
      his point within an inch of my bosom; and nothing but a spring backwards
      would have saved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At length, after a long-contested struggle, he made a feint within, and
      then without, the guard, and succeeded in touching my sword-arm, above the
      wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A touch, I believe,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A mere nothing,' said I; for although I felt the blood running down my
      sleeve, and oozing between my fingers, I was annoyed to think he had made
      the first hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah, François, these Mamelukes were not of the première force, after all.
      I have only been jesting all this time; see here.' With that he closed on
      me, in a very different style from his former attack. Pushing and parrying
      with the rapidity of lightning, he evinced a skill in 'skirmish' I did not
      believe him possessed of. In this, however, I was his master; and in a few
      seconds gave him my point sharply, but not deeply, in the shoulder.
      Instead of dropping his weapon when he received mine, he returned the
      thrust. I parried it, and touched him again, a little lower down. He
      winced this time, and muttered something I could not catch. 'You shall
      have it now,' said he, aloud; 'I owe you this,&mdash;and this.' True to
      his word, he twice pierced me in the back, outside the guard. Encouraged
      by success, he again closed on me; while I, piqued by his last assault,
      advanced to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our tempers were both excited; but his far more than mine. The struggle
      was a severe one. Three several times his blade passed between my arm and
      my body; and at last after a desperate rally, he dropped on one knee, and
      gave me the point here, beneath the chest. Before he could extricate his
      blade, I plunged mine into his chest, and pushed till I heard the hilt
      come clink against his ribs. The blood spurted upwards, over my face and
      breast, as he fell backwards. I wiped it hurriedly from my eyes, and bent
      over him. He gave a shudder and a little faint moan, and all was still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You killed him?&rdquo; cried out three or four of us together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> yes. The 'coup' was mortal; he never stirred after. As for
      me,&rdquo; continued Francois, &ldquo;I surrendered myself a prisoner to the officer
      on guard at the gate. I was tried ten days after by a military commission,
      and acquitted. My own evidence was my accusation and my defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ventrebleu!</i> had I been on the court-martial, you had not been here
      to tell the story,&rdquo; said the old major, as his face became almost purple
      with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Tascher, jeeringly. &ldquo;What signifies a maître d'armes the
      more or the less?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur will probably explain himself,&rdquo; said François, with one of his
      cold smiles of excessive deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is exactly what I mean to do, François.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sirs, none of this,&rdquo; broke in the major. &ldquo;Lieutenant Tascher, you
      may not fancy being placed under an arrest when the enemy is in the field.
      Master Francois, do you forget the sentence of a court-martial is hanging
      over your head for an affair at Elchingen, where you insulted a young
      officer of the hussars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I must be permitted to say that Maître François conducted
      himself like a man of honor,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i> and got the worst of it besides,&rdquo; cried he, placing his
      hand on his hip. The tone of his voice as he said this, and the grimace he
      made, restored the party once more to good-humor, and we chatted away
      pleasantly till day was breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Tascher strolled along with me towards my quarters, I was rejoiced to
      discover that he had never heard of my name as being mixed up in the
      Chouan conspiracy; nor was he aware with how little reason he believed me
      to be favored by fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      I received, however, all his congratulations without any desire to
      undeceive him. Already had I learned the worldly lesson, that while
      friends cling closer in adversity, your mere acquaintance deems your
      popularity your greatest merit; and I at length perceived that, however
      ungenial in many respects the companionship, the life of isolation I led
      had rendered me suspected by others, and in a career, too, where frankness
      was considered the first of virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assented at once with pleasure to the prospect of our meeting frequently
      while in camp. My own regiment had joined Davoust's corps, and I was glad
      to have the society of some others of my own age, if only to wean myself
      from my habits of solitude. While I formed these plans for the future, I
      little anticipated what events were in store for me, nor how soon I should
      be thrown among scenes and people totally different from those with which
      I had ever mixed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mess with us, then, Burke,&mdash;that's agreed,&rdquo; said Tascher. &ldquo;They
      're excellent fellows, these cuirassiers of ours, and I know you 'll like
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this promise we parted, hoping to meet on the morrow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. THE MILL ON THE HOLITSCH ROAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      At an early hour on the morning of the 4th came orders for the &ldquo;Garde à
      Cheval&rdquo; to hold themselves in readiness, with two squadrons of the
      carabineers, on the road to Holitsch; part of this force being under the
      command of General d'Auvergne. We found ourselves fully equipped and in
      waiting soon after eight o'clock. From the &ldquo;tenue&rdquo; and appearance of the
      troops, it was evident that no measure of active service was contemplated;
      yet, if a review were intended, we could not guess why so small a force
      had been selected. As usual on such occasions, many conjectures were
      hazarded, and a hundred explanations passed current,&mdash;one scarcely a
      whit better than the other, when at last we perceived a peloton of
      dragoons advancing towards us at a brisk trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word was passed to close up and draw swords; and scarcely was it
      obeyed when the staff of the Emperor came up. They were all in the full
      blaze of their gala uniforms, brilliant with crosses and decorations.
      Napoleon alone wore the simple costume of the &ldquo;Chasseurs of the Garde,&rdquo;
       with the decoration of the Legion; but his proud look and his flashing eye
      made him conspicuous above them all. He was mounted on his favorite
      charger &ldquo;Marengo,&rdquo; and seemed to enjoy the high spirit of the mettled
      animal, as he tossed his long mane about, and lashed his sides with his
      great silken tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the cortége passed we closed up the rear, and followed at a sharp pace,
      more than ever puzzled to divine what was going forward. After about two
      hours' riding, during which we never drew bridle, we saw a party of
      staff-officers in front, who, saluting the Emperor, joined the cortége. At
      the same instant General d'Auvergne passed close beside me, and whispered
      in my ear. &ldquo;Bernadotte has just come up, and been most coldly received.&rdquo; I
      wished to ask him what was the object of the whole movement, but he was
      gone before I could do so. In less than a quarter of an hour afterwards we
      left the highroad, and entered upon a large plain, where the only object I
      could perceive was an old mill, ruined and dilapidated. Towards this the
      imperial staff rode forward, while the peloton in front wheeled about, and
      rode to the rear of our squadrons. The next moment we were halted, and
      drawn up in order of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these movements were going forward, I remarked that the Emperor had
      dismounted from his horse and dismissed his staff, all save Marshal
      Berthier, who stood at a little distance from him. Several dismounted
      dragoons were employed in lighting two immense fires,&mdash;a process
      which Napoleon appeared to watch with great interest for a second or two;
      and then, taking out his glass, he remained for several minutes intently
      surveying the great road to Holitsch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this direction at once every eye was turned; but nothing could we see.
      The road led through a wide open country for some miles, and at last
      disappeared in the recesses of a dark pine wood, that covered the horizon
      for miles on either side. Meanwhile Napoleon, with his hands clasped
      behind his back, walked hurriedly backwards and forwards beside the
      blazing fires, stopping at intervals to look along the road, and then
      resuming his walk as before. He was not more than two hundred paces from
      where we stood, and I could mark well his gesture of impatience, as he
      closed his glass each time, after looking in vain towards Holitsch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Burke,&rdquo; whispered one of my brother officers beside me, &ldquo;I should
      not fancy being the man who keeps him waiting in that fashion. Look at
      Berthier, how he keeps aloof; he knows that something is brewing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can it all mean?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Who can he be expecting here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say now,&rdquo; whispered my companion, &ldquo;that Davoust cannot hold the
      bridge of Goding, and must fall back before the Russian column; and that
      Napoleon has invited Alexander to a conference here to gain time to
      reinforce Davoust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; but the Czar is too wily an enemy for that to succeed; and
      probably hence the delay, which appears to irritate him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The supposition, more plausible than most of those I heard before, was
      still contradicted by the account of the Emperor Alexander's retreat; and
      again was I at a loss to reconcile these discrepancies, when I beheld
      Napoleon, with his glass to his eye, motion with his hand for Berthier to
      come forward. I turned towards the road, and now could distinguish in the
      distance a dark object moving towards us. A few minutes after the sun
      shone out, and I remarked the glitter of arms, stretching in a long line;
      while my companion, with the aid of a glass, called out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see them plainly; they are lancers. The escort are Hungarians, and
      there's a <i>calèche</i>, with four horses in front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor stood motionless, his arms folded on his breast, and his head
      a little leaned forward, exactly as I have seen him represented in so many
      pictures and statues. His eyes were thrown downwards; and as he stirred
      the blazing wood with his foot, one could easily perceive how intensely
      his mind was occupied with deep thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clattering sound of cavalry now turned my attention to another
      quarter; and I saw, exactly in front of us, and about five hundred paces
      off, a regiment of Hungarian Hussars, and some squadrons of Hulans drawn
      up. I had little time to mark their gorgeous equipment and splendid
      uniform, for already the <i>calèche</i> had drawn up at the roadside, and
      Prince John of Lichtenstein, descending, took off his chapeau, and offered
      his arm to assist another to alight. Slowly, and, as it seemed, with
      effort, a tall thin figure, in the white uniform of the Austrian Guard,
      stepped from the carriage to the ground. The same instant the officers of
      the staff fell back, and I saw Napoleon advance with open arms to embrace
      him. The Austrian emperor&mdash;for it was Francis himself&mdash;seemed
      scarcely able to control the emotion he felt at this moment; and we could
      see that his head rested for several seconds on Napoleon's shoulder. And
      what a moment must that have been! How deeply must the pride of the
      descendant of the Cæsars have felt the humiliation which made him thus a
      suppliant before one he deemed a mere Corsican adventurer! What a pang it
      must have cost his haughty spirit as he uttered the words, <i>Mon frère!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      As they walked side by side towards the plateau, where the fires were
      lighted, it was easy to mark that Napoleon was the speaker, while Francis
      merely bowed from time to time, or made a gesture of seeming assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Emperor arrived at the place of conference, we fell back some fifty
      yards; and although the air was still and frosty, and the silence was
      perfect around, we could not catch a word on either side. After about an
      hour the conversation appeared to assume a tone of gayety and good-humor,
      and we could hear the sovereigns laughing repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference lasted for above two hours, when once more the emperors
      embraced, and, as we thought, with more cordiality, and separated; the
      Emperor of Austria returning, accompanied by Prince Lichtenstein; while
      Napoleon stood for some minutes beside the fire as if musing, and then,
      beckoning his staff to follow, he walked towards the highroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the Austrian emperor reached his carriage, when Savary,
      bareheaded and breathless, stood beside the door of it. He was the bearer
      of a message from Napoleon. The next moment the <i>calèche</i> started,
      accompanied by Savary, who, with a single aide-de-camp, took the road
      towards the Austrian headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Napoleon was about to mount his horse, I saw General d'Auvergne move
      forward towards him. A few words passed between them; and then the
      general, riding up to where I stood, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burke, you are to remain here, and if any orders arrive from General
      Savary, hasten with them to the headquarters of his Majesty. In twelve
      hours you will be relieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he galloped back to the imperial staff; and soon after the
      squadrons defiled into the road, the cortége dashed forward, and all that
      remained of that memorable scene was the dying embers of the fires beside
      which the fate of Europe was decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old mill of Holitsch had been deserted when the Austrian and Russian
      columns took up their position before Austerlitz. The miller and his
      household fled at the first news of the advance, and had not dared to
      return. It was a solitary spot at best: a wild heath, without shelter of
      any kind, stretched away for miles on all sides; but now, in its utter
      loneliness, it was the most miserable-looking place that can be conceived.
      While, therefore, I contented myself with the hope that my stay there
      might not be long, I resolved to do what I could to render my quarters
      more comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first care was my horse, which I picketed in the kitchen, where I was
      happy to find an abundant supply of firewood; my next, was to explore the
      remainder of the concern, in which I discovered traces of its having been
      already occupied by the allied troops,&mdash;rude caricatures of the
      French army in full <i>déroute</i>, before terrible-looking dragoons in
      Austrian and Russian uniforms, ornamented the walls in many parts; whole
      columns of French prisoners were depicted begging their lives from a
      single Austrian grenadier; and one figure, which it could be easily
      discovered was intended for Napoleon himself, was about to be hanged upon
      a tree, to the very marked satisfaction, as it would seem, of a group of
      Russian officers, who stood by, laughing. It is easy to smile at the
      ridicule of which fortune has thwarted the application and so I amused
      myself a good while by contemplating these grotesque frescos.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a more welcome sight still awaited me, in a small chamber at the top
      of the building, where, in large letters, written with chalk on the door,
      I read, &ldquo;Rittmeister von Oxenhausen's quarters.&rdquo; Here, to my exceeding
      delight, I discovered a neatly-furnished chamber, with a bed, sofa, and,
      better still, a table, on which the remains of the Rittmeister's sapper
      yet stood,&mdash;a goodly ham, the greater part of a capon, a loaf of
      wheaten bread, and an earthenware crock, with a lid of brass, containing
      about two bottles of Austrian red wine. This was a most agreeable surprise
      to me,&mdash;a pleasant exchange from the meagre meal of bread and cheese
      I had but time to procure from a sergeant of my troop at parting. It need
      not be supposed that I hesitated long about becoming the Rittmeister's
      successor; and so I drew the chair to the table, and the table nearer to
      the fire,&mdash;for, singularly enough, the embers of a wood fire still
      slumbered on the hearth. Having taken the keen edge off an appetite the
      cold air had whetted to the sharpest, I began an inspection of my
      quarters, first having replenished the fire with some logs of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chamber was an octagon, with five windows in as many of the faces, a
      fireplace and two doors occupying the other three. One of the doors&mdash;that
      by which I entered,&mdash;opened from the stairs; the other led into a
      granary, or something of that nature,&mdash;at least, so I conjectured,
      from a heap of sacks which littered the floor, and filled one corner
      completely. As I could not discover any corn, I resolved on sharing my
      loaf with my horse,&mdash;a meal every campaigning steed is well
      accustomed to make. And now, returning to my little chamber, I resumed my
      supper with all the satisfaction of one who felt he had made his rounds of
      duty, and might enjoy repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I knew the Château de Holitsch, where the Emperor Francis held his
      quarters, was some six leagues distant, I guessed that General Savary was
      not likely to return from his mission before morning at very soonest; and
      so it behooved me to make my arrangements for passing the night where I
      was. Having, then, looked to my horse, for whose bedding I made free with
      some dozen of the corn-sacks in the granary, I brought up to my own
      quarters a supply of wood; and having fastened the door, and secured the
      windows as well as I was able, I lit my meerschaum, and lay down before
      the fire in as happy a frame of mind as need be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, I began to fancy that fortune had done tormenting, and was now
      about to treat me more kindly. The notice of the Emperor had relieved my
      heart of a load which never ceased to press on it, and I could not help
      feeling that a fairer prospect was opening before me. It is true, time and
      misfortune had both blunted the ardor of enthusiasm with which I started
      in life; the daring aspirations after liberty, the high-souled desire for
      personal distinction, had subsided into calmer hopes and less ambitious
      yearnings. Young as I yet was, I experienced in myself that change of
      sentiment and feeling which comes upon other men later on in life; and I
      was gradually reconciling myself to that sense of duty which teaches a man
      well to play his part, in whatever station he may be called to act, rather
      than indulge in those overweening wishes for pre-eminence, which in their
      accomplishment are so often disappointing, and in their failure a source
      of regret and unhappiness. These feelings were impressed on me more by the
      force of events than by any process of my own reasoning. The career in
      which I first started as a boy had led to nothing but misfortune. The
      affection I conceived for one,&mdash;the only one I ever loved,&mdash;was
      destined equally to end unhappily. The passion for liberty, in which all
      my first aspirations were centred, had met the rude shocks which my own
      convictions suggested; and now I perceived that I must begin life anew,
      endeavoring to forget the influences whose shadows darkened my early days,
      and carve out my destiny in a very different path from what I once
      intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were my last waking thoughts, as my head sank on my arm, and I fell
      into a deep sleep. The falling of a log from the fire awoke me suddenly. I
      rubbed my eyes, and for a second or two could not remember where I was. At
      length I became clearer in mind, and looking at my watch, perceived it was
      but two o'clock. As the flame of the replenished fire threw its light
      through the room, I remarked that the door into the granary stood ajar.
      This struck me as strange. I thought I could remember shutting it before I
      went to sleep. Yes,&mdash;I recollected perfectly placing a chair against
      it, as the latch was bad, and a draught of cold air came in that way; and
      now the chair was pushed back into the room, and the door lay open. A
      vague feeling, half suspicion, half curiosity, kept me thinking of the
      circumstance, when by chance&mdash;the merest chance&mdash;my eyes fell
      upon the table where I had left my sabre and my pistols. What was my
      amazement to find that one of the latter&mdash;that which lay nearest the
      door&mdash;was missing!
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant I was on my feet. Nothing can combat drowsiness like the
      sense of fear; and I became perfectly awake in a moment. Examining the
      room with caution, I found everything in the same state as I had left it,
      save the door and the missing pistol. The granary alone, then, could be
      the shelter of the invader, whoever he might be. What was to be done? I
      was totally unprovided with light, save what the fire afforded; and even
      were it otherwise, I should expose myself by carrying one, long before I
      could hope to detect a concealed enemy. The best plan I could hit upon
      seemed to secure the door once more; and then, placing myself in such a
      position as not to be commanded by it again, to wait for morning
      patiently. This then, I did at once; and having examined my remaining
      pistol, and found the charge and priming all safe, I drew my sabre, and
      sat down between the door and the window, but so that it should open
      against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few sensations are more acutely painful than the exercise of the hearing
      when pushed to intensity. The unceasing effort to catch the slightest
      sound soon becomes fatigue, and as the organ grows weary, the mental
      anxiety grows more acute; and then begins a struggle between the failing
      sense and the excited brain. The spectral images of the eye in fever are
      not one half so terrible as the strange discordant tones that jar upon the
      tympanum in such a state as this. Each inanimate object seems endowed with
      its own power of voice, and whispering noises come stealing through the
      dead silence of midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state of almost frenzied anxiety I sat long,&mdash;my eyes turned
      towards the door, which oftentimes I fancied I could perceive to move. At
      length the thought occurred to me, that by affecting sleep, if any one lay
      concealed within whose object was to enter the room, this would probably
      induce him.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had not long to wait for the success of my scheme. The long-drawn
      breathing of my seeming slumber was not continued for more than a few
      minutes, when I saw the door slowly, almost imperceptibly, move. At first
      it stirred inch by inch; then gradually it opened wider and wider till it
      met the obstacle of the chair. There now came a pause of several seconds,
      during which it demanded all my efforts to sustain my part,&mdash;the
      throbbing at my throat and temples increasing almost beyond endurance, and
      the impulse to dash forward, and flinging wide the door, confront my
      enemy, being nearly too much for my resistance. Again it moved noiselessly
      as before; and then a hand stole out, and, laying hold of the chair,
      pushed it slowly backwards. The gray light of the breaking day fell upon
      the spot, and I could see that the cuff of the coat was laced with gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time my anxiety became intense. Another second or two and I should be
      engaged in the conflict,&mdash;I knew not against how many. I clutched my
      sabre more fairly in my grasp, as my breathing grew thicker and shorter.
      The chair still continued to slide silently into the room, and already the
      arm of the man within protruded. Now was the moment, or never; and with a
      spring, I threw myself on it, and, pinioning the wrist in my hands, held
      it down upon the floor while I opposed my weight against the door.
    </p>
    <p>

      <img src="images/090.jpg" alt="090 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Quick as lightning the other hand appeared, armed with a pistol; and I had
      but a moment to crouch my head nearly to the ground when a bullet whizzed
      past and smashed through the window behind me, while with a crash the
      frail door gave way to a strong push, and a man sprang fiercely forward to
      seize me by the throat. Jumping backward, I recovered my feet; but before
      I could raise my pistol he made a spring at me, and we both rolled
      together on the floor. On the pistol both our hands met, and the struggle
      was for the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice was it pointed at my heart; but my hand held the lock, and not all
      his efforts could unclasp it. At last I freed my right hand from the
      sword-knot of my sabre, and striking him with my clenched knuckles on the
      forehead, threw him back. His grasp relaxed at the instant, and I wrenched
      the pistol from his fingers, and placed the muzzle against his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another second and he would have rolled a corpse before me, when, to my
      horror and amazement, I saw in my antagonist my once friend, <i>Henri de
      Beauvais</i>. I flung the weapon from me, as I cried out, &ldquo;De Beauvais,
      forgive me! forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deathly paleness came over his features; his eyes grew glazed and filmy,
      and with a low groan he fell fainting on the floor. I bathed his temples
      with water; I moistened his pale lips; I rubbed his clammy fingers. But it
      was long before he rallied; and when he did come to himself and looked up,
      he closed his eyes again, as though the sight of me was worse than death
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Henri!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;a cup of wine, my friend, and you will be better
      presently. Thank God, this has not ended as it might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyes towards me, but with a look of proud and unforgiving
      sternness, while he uttered not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unfair to blame me, De Beauvais, for this,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Once more I
      say, forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips moved, and some sounds came forth, but I could not hear the
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;it's past and over now. Here is my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You struck me with that hand,&rdquo; said he, in a deep, distinct voice, as
      though every word came from the very bottom of his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I did, Henri, my own life was on the blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh that you had taken mine with it!&rdquo; said he, with a bitterness I can
      never forget. &ldquo;I am the first of my name that ever received a blow; would
      I were to be the last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, De Beauvais&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I forget nothing. Be assured, too, I never shall forget this
      night. With any other than yourself I should not despair of that atonement
      for an injury which alone can wash out such a stain; but <i>you</i>,&mdash;I
      know you well,&mdash;<i>you</i> will not give me this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, De Beauvais; I will not,&rdquo; said I, calmly. &ldquo;Sorry am I that
      even an accident should have brought us into collision. It is a mischance
      I feel deeply, and shall for many a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, sir,&rdquo; cried he, as, starting up, his eyes flashed with passion and
      his cheek grew scarlet,&mdash;&ldquo;and I, sir!&mdash;what are to be my
      feelings? Think you, that because I am an exile and an outcast,&mdash;forced
      by misfortune to wear the livery of one who is not my rightful sovereign,&mdash;that
      my sense of personal honor is the less, and that the mark of an insult is
      not as blood-stained on my conscience as ever it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but passion could blind you to the fact that there can be no
      insult where no intention could exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare me your casuistry, sir,&rdquo; replied he, with an insolent wave of his
      hand, while he sank into a chair, and laid his head upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant my temper, provoked beyond endurance, was about to give
      way, when I perceived that a handkerchief was bound tightly around his leg
      above the knee, where a great stain of blood marked his trouser. The
      thought of his being wounded banished every particle of resentment, and
      laying my hand on his shoulder, I said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Beauvais, I know not one but yourself to whom I would three times say,
      forgive me. But we were friends once, when we were both happier. For the
      sake of him who is no more,&mdash;poor Charles de Meudon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A traitor, sir,&mdash;a base traitor to the king of his fathers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This I will not endure!&rdquo; said I, passionately. &ldquo;No one shall dare&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, dare, sir!&mdash;such was the word. To asperse the memory of one like
      him is to dare that which no man can, with truth and honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sir, I'm ready,&rdquo; said Be Beauvais, rising, and pointing to the
      door, &ldquo;Sortons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one who has not heard that one word pronounced by the lips of a
      Frenchman can conceive how much of savage enmity and deadly purpose it
      implies. It is the challenge which, if unaccepted, stamps cowardice
      forever on the man who declines it: from that hour all equality ceases
      between those whom a combat had placed on the same footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sortons!&rdquo; The word rang in my ears, and tingled through my very heart,
      while a host of different impulses swayed me,&mdash;shame, sorrow, wounded
      pride, all struggling for the mastery: but above them all, a better and a
      higher spirit,&mdash;the firm resolve, come what would, to suffer no
      provocation De Beauvais could offer, to make me stand opposite to him as
      an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to think, sir?&rdquo; said he, with a voice scarcely articulate from
      passion,&mdash;&ldquo;what am I to think of your hesitation? or why do you stand
      inactive here? Is it that you are meditating what new insult can be added
      to those you have heaped on me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I replied, firmly; &ldquo;so far from thinking of offence, I am but
      too sorry for the words I have already spoken. I should have remembered,
      and remembering, should have made allowance for, the strength of partisan
      feelings, which have their origin in a noble, but, as I believe, a
      mistaken source.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; interrupted he, in mockery. &ldquo;Is it, then, come to this? Am I, a
      Frenchman born, to be lectured on my loyalty and allegiance by a foreign
      mercenary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even that taunt, De Beauvais, shall avail you anything. I am firm in
      my resolve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> then,&rdquo; cried he, with savage energy, &ldquo;there remains but
      this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he leaped from his chair, and sprang towards me. In so doing,
      however, his knee struck the table, and with a groan of agony, he reeled
      back and fell on the floor, while from his reopened wound a torrent of
      blood gushed out and deluged the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second or two he motioned me away with his hand; but as his weakness
      increased, he lay passive and unresisting, and suffered me to arrest the
      bleeding by such means as I was able to practise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long time ere I could stanch the gaping orifice, which had been
      inflicted by a sabre, and cut clean through the high boot and deep into
      the thigh. Fortunately for his recovery, he had himself succeeded in
      getting off the boot before, and the wound lay open to my surgical skill.
      Lifting him cautiously in my arms, I laid him on the bed, and moistened
      his lips with a little wine. Still the debility continued,&mdash;no signs
      of returning strength were there; but his features, pale and fallen, were
      glazed with a cold sweat that hung in heavy drops upon his brow and
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was agony like mine. I saw his life was ebbing fast; the respiration
      was growing fainter and more irregular; his pulse could scarce be felt;
      yet dare I not leave my post to seek for assistance. A hundred thoughts
      whirled through my puzzled brain, and among the rest, the self-accusing
      one that I was the cause of his death. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;better far to
      have stood before his pistol, at all the hazard of my life, than see him
      thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an instant all his angry speeches and his insulting gestures were
      forgotten. He looked so like what I once knew him, that my mind was
      wandering back again to former scenes and times, and all resentment was
      lost in the flood of memory. Poor fellow! what a sad destiny was his!
      fighting against the arms of his country,&mdash;a mourner over the
      triumphs of his native land! Alien that I was, this pang at least was
      spared me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these thoughts crossed my mind, I felt him press my hand. Overjoyed, I
      knelt down and whispered some words in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; muttered he, in a low, plaintive tone; &ldquo;not all lost,&mdash;not
      all! La Vendee yet remains!&rdquo; He was dreaming.

      CHAPTER VII. THE ARMISTICE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As I sat thus watching with steadfast gaze the features of the sleeping
      man, I heard the clattering of a horse's hoofs on the pavement beneath,
      and the next moment the heavy step of some one ascending the stairs.
      Suddenly the door was flung wide open, and an officer in the handsome
      uniform of the Austrian Imperial Guard entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse this scant ceremony, Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, bowing with much
      courtesy, &ldquo;but I almost despaired of finding you out. I come from Holitsch
      with despatches for your Emperor; they are most pressing, as I believe
      this note will inform you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I threw my eye over the few lines addressed by General Savary to the
      officer in waiting at Holitsch, and commanding the utmost speed in
      forwarding the despatch that accompanied them, the officer drew near the
      bed where De Beauvais was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mère de ciel</i>, it is the count!&rdquo; cried he, starting back with
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, interrupting him; &ldquo;I found him here on my arrival. He is
      badly wounded, and should be removed at once. How can this be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily. I 'll despatch my orderly at once to Holitsch, and remain here
      till he return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if our troops advance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! we're all safe on that score; the armistice is signed. The very
      despatch in your hands, I believe, concludes the treaty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This warned me that I was delaying too long the important duty intrusted
      to me, and with a hurried entreaty to the Austrian not to leave De
      Beauvais, I hastened down the stairs, and proceeded to saddle for the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word, Monsieur,&rdquo; said the officer, as I was in the act of mounting.
      &ldquo;May I ask the name of him to whom my brother officers owe the life of a
      comrade much beloved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Burke; and yours, Monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berghausen, <i>chef d'escadron</i> of the Imperial Guard. If ever you
      should come to Vienna&mdash;&rdquo; But I lost the words that followed, as,
      spurring my horse to a gallop, I set out towards the headquarters of the
      Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I rode forward, my eyes were ever anxiously bent in the direction of
      our camp, not knowing at what moment I might see the advance of a column
      along the road, and dreading lest, before the despatches should reach the
      Emperor's house, the advanced vedettes should capture the little party at
      Holitsch. At no period of his career was Napoleon more incensed against
      the adherents of the Bourbons; and if De Beauvais should fall into his
      hands, I was well aware that nothing could save him. The Emperor always
      connected in his mind&mdash;and with good reason, too&mdash;the
      machinations of the Royalists with the plans of the English Government. He
      knew that the land which afforded the asylum to their king was the refuge
      of the others also; and many of the heaviest denunciations against the
      &ldquo;perfide Albion&rdquo; had no other source than the dread, of which he could
      never divest himself, that the legitimate monarch would one day be
      restored to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      While such were Napoleon's feelings, the death of the Duc d'Enghien had
      heightened the hatred of the Bourbonists to a pitch little short of
      madness. My own unhappy experience made me more than ever fearful of being
      in any way implicated with the members of this party, and I rode on as
      though life itself depended on my reaching the imperial headquarters some
      few minutes earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I approached the camp, I was overjoyed to find that no movement was in
      contemplation. The men were engaged in cleaning their arms and
      accoutrements, restoring the broken wagons and gun-carriages, and
      repairing, as far as might be, the disorders of the day of battle. The
      officers stood in groups here and there, chatting at their ease; while the
      only men under arms were the new conscript? just arrived from France,&mdash;a
      force of some thousands,&mdash;brought by forced marches from the banks of
      the Rhine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd of officers near the headquarters of the Emperor pressed closely
      about me as I descended from my horse, eager to learn what information I
      brought from Holitsch; for they were not aware that I had been stationed
      nearly half-way on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Burke,&rdquo; said General d'Auvergne, as he drew his arm within mine,
      &ldquo;your coming has been anxiously looked for this morning. I trust the
      despatches you carry may, if not Contradict, at least explain what has
      occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the officer from Holitsch?&rdquo; said the aide-decamp of the Emperor,
      coming hurriedly forward. &ldquo;The despatch, sir!&rdquo; cried he; and the next
      moment hastened to the little hut which Napoleon occupied as his bivouac.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only other person in the open space where I stood was an officer of
      the lancers, whose splashed and travel-stained dress seemed to say he had
      been employed like myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy, Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, bowing, &ldquo;that you have had a sharp ride also
      this morning. I have just arrived from Göding&mdash;four leagues&mdash;in
      less than an hour; and with all that, too late, I believe, to remedy what
      has occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Davoust has been tricked into an armistice, and suffered the Russians to
      pass the bridge. The Emperor Alexander has taken advantage of the
      negotiations with Austria, and got his army clear through; so, at least,
      it would seem. I saw Napoleon tear the despatch into fragments, and stamp
      his foot upon them. But here he comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were scarcely spoken when the Emperor came rapidly up, followed
      by his staff. He wore a gray surtout, trimmed with dark fur, and had his
      hands clasped within the cuffs of the coat. His face was pale as death,
      and save a slight contraction of his brows, there was nothing to show any
      appearance of displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who brought the despatch from Göding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, Sire,&rdquo; said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are the roads, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much cut up, and in one place a torrent has carried away part of a
      bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it,&mdash;I knew it,&rdquo; said he, bitterly; &ldquo;it is too late. Duroc,&rdquo;
       cried he, while the words seemed to come forth with a hissing sound, &ldquo;did
      I not tell you, 'Grattez le Russe, et vous trouverez le Tartare!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were graven in my memory from that hour; even yet, I can recall
      the very accents as when I heard them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, sir,&rdquo; said he, turning suddenly towards me, &ldquo;you came from
      General Savary. Return to him with this letter. Have you written, Duroc?
      Well, you'll deliver this to General Savary at Holitsch. He may require
      you to proceed to Göding. Are you well mounted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then, sir. I made you a captain yesterday; let us see if you can
      win your spurs to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the time I received the despatch to that in which I was in the saddle
      not more than five minutes elapsed. The idea of being chosen by the
      Emperor himself for a service was a proud one, and I resolved to acquit
      myself with credit. With what concert does one's heart beat to the free
      stride of a mettled charger! how does each bold plunge warm the blood and
      stir up the spirits! and as, careering free over hill and valley, we pass
      in our flight the clouds that drift above, how does the sense of freedom,
      realized as it is, impart a feeling of ecstasy to our minds! Our thoughts,
      revelling on the wayward liberty our course suggests, rise free and
      untrammelled from the doubts and cares of every-day life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onward I went, and soon the old mill came in sight, rearing its ruined
      head amid the black desolation of the plain. I could not resist the
      impulse to see what had become of De Beauvais; and leading my horse into
      the kitchen, I hastened up the stairs and through the rooms. But all were
      deserted; the little chamber lay open, the granary too; but no one was
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a mind relieved, in a great measure, from anxiety, I remounted and
      continued my way; and soon entered the dark woods of Holitsch. The château
      and demesne were a private estate of the Emperor Francis, and once formed
      a favorite resort of Joseph the Second in his hunting excursions. The
      château itself was a large, irregular mass of building, but still, with
      all its incongruity of architecture, not devoid of picturesque effect,&mdash;and
      the older portion of it was even handsome. While I stood in front of a
      long terrace, on which several windows opened from a gallery that ran
      along one side of the château, I was somewhat surprised that no guard was
      to be seen, nor even a single sentinel on duty. I dismounted, and leading
      my horse, approached the avenue that led up between a double range of
      statues to the door. An old man, dressed in the slouched hat and light
      blue jacket of a Bohemian peasant, was busily engaged in wrapping matting
      around some shrubs, to protect them from the frost. A little boy&mdash;his
      second self in costume&mdash;stood beside him with his pruning-knife, and
      stared at me with a kind of stupid wonder as I approached. With some
      difficulty I made out from the old man that the Emperor occupied a smaller
      building called the Kaiser-Lust, about half a league distant in the
      forest, having given strict orders that no one was to approach the château
      nor its immediate grounds. It was his favorite retreat, and perhaps he did
      not wish it should be associated in his mind with a period of such
      misfortune. The old peasant continued his occupation while he spoke, never
      lifting his head from his work, and seeming all absorbed in the necessity
      of what he was engaged in. As I inquired the nearest road to the imperial
      quarters, he employed me to assist him for a moment in his task by holding
      one end of the matting, with which he was now about to envelop a marble
      statue of Maria Theresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not refuse a request so naturally proffered; and while I did so, a
      little wicket opened at a short distance off, and a tall man, in a gray
      surtout and a plain cocked hat without a feather, came forward. He held a
      riding-whip in his hand, and seemed, from his splashed equipment, to have
      just descended from the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Fritz,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I hope the frost has done us no mischief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old gardener turned round at the words, and, touching his hat
      respectfully, continued his work, while he replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mein Herr; it was but a white hoar, and everything has escaped well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whom have you got here for an assistant, may I ask?&rdquo; said he,
      pointing to me, whom he now saw for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the question was asked in German, although I understood it I left the
      reply to the gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; said the old fellow, in a tone of easy indifference; &ldquo;I think
      he must be a soldier of some sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled at the remark, and, turning towards me, said, in French,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, perhaps, unaware, sir, being a stranger, that it is the Emperor
      of Austria's desire this château should not be intruded on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My offending, sir,&rdquo; interrupted I, &ldquo;was purely accidental. I am the
      bearer of despatches for General Savary; and having stopped to inquire
      from this honest man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The general has taken his departure for Göding,&rdquo; he broke in, without
      paying further attention to my explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Goding! and may I ask what distance that may be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely a league, if you can hit upon the right path; the road lies
      yonder, where you see that dead fir-tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; said I, touching my hat; &ldquo;and must now ask my friend
      here to release me,&mdash;my orders are of moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may find some difficulty in the wood, after all,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I 'll
      send my groom part of the way with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could proffer my thanks suitably for such an unexpected
      politeness, he had disappeared in the garden through which he entered a
      few minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, my worthy friend, tell me the name of that gentleman; he's one of
      the Emperor's staff, if I mistake not. I 'm certain I 've seen the face
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had,&rdquo; said the old fellow, laughing, &ldquo;you could scarcely forget
      him; old Frantzerl is just the same these twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he could reply, the other was at my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he will conduct you to the highroad. I wish you a
      good journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were uttered in a tone somewhat more haughty than his previous
      ones; and contenting myself with a civil acknowledgment of his attention,
      I bowed and returned to my horse, which the little peasant child had been
      holding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, Monsieur,&rdquo; said the groom, who, dressed in a plain dark brown
      livery, was mounted on a horse of great size and symmetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he dashed forward at a gallop which all my efforts could not
      succeed in overtaking. In less than ten minutes the man halted, and,
      waiting till I came up, he pointed to a gentle acclivity before me, across
      which the highroad led.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There lies the road, sir; continue your speed, and in twenty minutes you
      reach Göding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word,&rdquo; said I, drawing forth my purse as I spoke,&mdash;&ldquo;one word.
      Tell me, who is your master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The groom smiled, slightly touched his hat, and without uttering a word,
      wheeled round his horse, and before I could repeat my question, was far on
      his road back to the château.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before me lay the river, and the little bridge of Göding, across which now
      the Russian columns were marching in rapid but compact order. Their
      cavalry had nearly all passed, and was drawn with some field-guns along
      the bank; while at half-cannon-shot distance, the corps of Davoust were
      drawn up in order of battle, and standing spectators of the scene. On an
      eminence of the field a splendid staff were assembled, accompanied by a
      troop of Tartar horsemen, whose gay colors and strange equipment were a
      remarkable feature of the picture; and here, I learned, the Emperor
      Alexander then was, accompanied by General Savary.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I drew near, my French uniform caught the eye of the latter, and he
      cantered forward to meet me. Tearing open the despatch with eagerness, he
      rapidly perused the few lines it contained; then, seizing me by the arm in
      his-strong grasp, he exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look yonder, sir! You see their columns extending to Serritz. Go back and
      tell his Majesty. But no; my own mission here is ended. You may return to
      Austerlitz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he rode back to the group around the Emperor, where I saw him a
      few minutes after addressing his Majesty; and then, after a formal
      leave-taking, turn his horse's head and set out towards Brunn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I retraced my steps towards the camp, I began to muse over the events
      which had just occurred; and even by the imperfect glimpses I could catch
      of the negotiations, could perceive that the Czar had out-manoeuvred
      Napoleon. It is true, I was not aware by what means the success had been
      obtained; nor was it for many a year after that I became cognizant of the
      few autograph lines by which Alexander induced Davoust to suspend his
      operations, under the pretence that the Austrian armistice included the
      Russian army. It was an unworthy act and ill befitting one whose high
      personal courage and chivalrous bearing gave promise of better things.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE COMPAGNIE D'ELITE
    </h2>
    <p>
      With whatever triumphant feelings the Emperor Napoleon may have witnessed
      the glorious termination of this brief campaign, to the young officers of
      the army it brought anything rather than satisfaction, and the news of the
      armistice was received in the camp with gloom and discontent. The
      brilliant action at Elchingen, and the great victory at Austerlitz, were
      hailed as a glorious presage of future successes, for which the
      high-sounding phrases of a bulletin were deemed but a poor requital. A
      great proportion of the army were new levies, who had not seen service,
      and felt proportionably desirous for opportunities of distinction; and to
      them the promise of a triumphant return to France was a miserable exchange
      for those battlefields on which they dreamed they should win honor and
      fame, and from whence they hoped to date their rise of fortune. Little did
      we guess, that while words of peace and avowals of moderation were on his
      lips, Napoleon was at that very moment meditating on the opening of that
      great campaign, which, beginning at Jena, was to end in the most bloody
      and long sustained of all his wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing, however, was now talked of but the fêtes which awaited us on our
      return to Paris,&mdash;while liberal grants of money were made to all the
      wounded, and no effort was spared which should mark that feeling of the
      Emperor's, which so conspicuously opened his bulletin, in the emphatic
      words, &ldquo;Soldiers, I am content with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Napoleon well understood, and indeed appeared to have anticipated, the
      disappointment the army would experience at this sudden cessation of
      hostilities; and endeavored now to divert the torrent of their enthusiasm
      into another and a safer channel. The bulk of the army were cantoned
      around Brunn and Olmutz; some picked regiments were recalled to Vienna,
      where the Emperor was soon expected to establish his headquarters; while
      many of those who had suffered most severely from forced marches and
      fatigues were formed into corps of escort to accompany the Russian
      prisoners&mdash;sixteen thousand in number&mdash;on their way to France;
      and lastly, a <i>compagnie d'élite</i>, as it was called, was selected to
      carry to the Senate the glorious spoils of victory,&mdash;forty-five
      standards taken on the field of Austerlitz, and now destined to grace the
      Palace of the Luxembourg.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had scarcely seated myself to the humble supper of my bivouac, when an
      orderly came to command me to General d'Auvergne's quarters. The little
      sitting-room he occupied, in a peasant hut, was so filled with officers
      that it was some time before I could approach him; and my impatience was
      not lessened by more than once hearing my name mentioned aloud,&mdash;a
      circumstance not a little trying to a young man in the presence of his
      superiors in station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here he is,&rdquo; said the general, beckoning to me to come forward.
      &ldquo;Burke, his Majesty has most graciously permitted me to include your name
      in the <i>compagnie d'élite</i>,&mdash;a testimony of his satisfaction
      you've every reason to be proud of. And just at the moment I was about to
      communicate the fact to you, I have received a message from Marshal Murat,
      requesting that I may permit you to serve on his own staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Captain,&rdquo; said an officer in the uniform of a colonel,&mdash;it was
      the first time I had been addressed by my new title, and I cannot express
      what a thrill of pleasure the word gave me,&mdash;&ldquo;Marshal Murat witnessed
      with pleasure the alacrity and steadiness of your conduct on the 2d, and
      has sent me with an offer which I fancy few officers would not deem a
      flattering one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unquestionably it is, Colonel,&rdquo; said General d'Auvergne; &ldquo;nay, more, I
      will say I regard it as the making of a young man's fortune, thus early in
      his career to have attracted such high notice. But I must be passive here;
      Captain Burke shall decide for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, sir, I shall cause you but little delay, if you will still
      permit me to serve on your own staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But stay, my boy, do not be rash in this affair. I will not insult your
      better feeling by dwelling on the little power I possess, and the very
      great enjoyed by Marshal Murat, of serving your interests; but I must say,
      that with him, and on his personal staff, opportunities of distinction&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here I must interpose,&rdquo; said the colonel, smiling courteously: &ldquo;with
      no officer in this army can a man expect to see service, in its boldest
      and most heroic colors, rather than with General d'Auvergne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&mdash;I feel it, too; and with him, if he will allow me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, my dear boy,&rdquo; said the old man, grasping my hand in his.
      &ldquo;Colonel, you must explain to the marshal how stands this matter; and he
      is too kind of heart and too noble of soul to think the worse of any of us
      for our obstinacy. And now, my young friend, make your arrangements to
      join the <i>compagnie d'élite</i>; they march to-morrow afternoon,&mdash;and
      this is a service you cannot decline. Leave me to make your
      acknowledgments to the marshal, and lose no more time here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Short as had been my absence from my quarters, when I re-entered, I
      descried Tascher seated at the table, and busily employed in discussing
      the last fragments of my supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my dear friend,&rdquo; said he, speaking with his mouth full,&mdash;&ldquo;you
      see what it is to have a <i>salmi</i> for supper. I sat eating a
      confounded mess of black bread, and blacker veal, for fifteen minutes,
      when the breeze brought me the odor of your delicious <i>plat</i>. It was
      in vain I summoned all my virtue to resist it; if there ever was a dish
      made to seduce a subaltern on service, it is this. But, I say, won't you
      eat something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; said I, half angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;See what a capital wing that is,&mdash;a little
      bare, to be sure; and there's the back of a pigeon. <i>Ma foi!</i> you
      have no reason to complain. I say, is it true you are named among the <i>compagnie
      d'élite</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded, and ate on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Diable!</i> there never was such fortune. What a glorious exchange for
      this confounded swamp, with its everlasting drill from morning to night,&mdash;shivering
      under arms for four hours, and shaking with the ague the rest of the day
      after,&mdash;marching, mid-leg in water, half frozen, and trying quick
      movements, when the very blood is in icicles! And then you 'll be enjoying
      Paris,&mdash;delightful Paris!&mdash;dining at the 'Rocher,' supping at
      the 'Cadran,' lounging into the <i>salons</i>, at the very time we shall
      be hiding ourselves amidst the straw of our bivouacs. I go mad to think of
      it. And, what's worse than all, there you sit, as little elated as if the
      whole thing were only the most natural in the world. I believe, on my
      word, you 'd not condescend to be surprised if you were gazetted Maréchal
      de France in to-morrow's gazette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I can bear, without testifying too much astonishment, to see my
      supper eaten by the man who does nothing but rate me into the bargain,
      perhaps I may plume myself on some equanimity of temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound your equanimity! It's very easy to be satisfied when one has
      everything his own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, Tascher, you deem me such a fortunate fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I do,&rdquo; replied he, quickly. &ldquo;You have had more good luck, and made
      less of it, than any one I ever knew. What a career you had before you
      when we met first! There was that pretty girl at the Tuileries quite ready
      to fall in love with you; I know it, because she rather took an air of
      coldness with me. Well, you let her be carried off by an old general, with
      a white head and a queue,&mdash;unquestionably a bit of pique on her part.
      Then, somehow or other, you contrived to pink the best swordsman of the
      army, little François there; and I never heard that the circumstance
      gained you a single conquest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true, my friend,&rdquo; said I, laughing; &ldquo;I confess it all. And, what is
      far worse, I acknowledge that until this moment I did not even know the
      advantages I was wilfully wasting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even now,&rdquo; continued he, not minding my interruption,&mdash;&ldquo;even
      now, you are about to return to Paris as one of the <i>élite</i>. Well, I
      'll wager twenty Naps that the only civil speeches you 'll hear will be
      from some musty old senators at the Luxembourg. Oh dear! if my amiable
      aunt, the Empress, would only induce my most benevolent uncle, the
      Emperor, to put me on that same list, depend upon it you 'd hear of
      Lieutenant Tascher in the 'Faubourg St. Honoré.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you seem to forget,&rdquo; said I, half piqued at last by the impertinence
      of his tone, &ldquo;that I have neither friends nor acquaintances; that,
      although a Frenchman by service, I am not so by birth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&mdash;what am I?&rdquo; interrupted he. &ldquo;A Creole, come from Heaven
      knows what far-away place beyond seas; that there never was a man with
      more expensive tastes, and smaller means to supply them,&mdash;with worse
      prospects, and better connections; in short, a kind of live antithesis.
      And yet, with all that, exchange places with me now, and see if, before a
      fortnight elapse, I have not more dinner invitations than any officer of
      the same grade within the Boulevards; watch if the prettiest girl at Paris
      is not at my side in the Opera. But here comes your official appointment,
      I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, an orderly of the &ldquo;Garde&rdquo; delivered a sealed packet into
      my hands, which, on opening, I discovered was a letter from General Duroc,
      wherein I read, that &ldquo;it was the wish of his Majesty, Emperor and King,
      that I, his well-beloved Thomas Burke, in conformity with certain
      instructions to be afterwards made known to me, should proceed with the <i>compagnie
      d'élite</i> to Paris, then and there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I read thus far aloud, Tascher interrupted me, snatching the paper from
      my hands, and continued thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then and there to mope, muse, and be <i>ennuyé</i> until such time as
      active service may again recall him to the army. My dear Burke, I am
      really sorry for you. Wars and campaigning may be&mdash;indeed they are&mdash;very
      fine things; but as the means, not the end. His Majesty, my uncle,&mdash;whom
      may Heaven preserve and soften his heart to his relations!&mdash;loves
      them for their own sake; but we,&mdash;you and I, for instance,&mdash;what
      possible reason can we have for risking our bones, and getting our flesh
      mangled, save the hope of promotion? And to what end that same promotion,
      if not for a wider sphere of pleasure and enjoyment? Think what a career a
      colonel, at our age, would have in Paris!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Tascher, I will not believe you in all this. If there were not
      something higher to reward one for the fatigues and dangers of a campaign
      than the mere sensual delights you allude to, I, for one, would soon doff
      the epaulettes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are impracticable,&rdquo; said he, half angrily; &ldquo;but it is as much from
      the isolation in which you have lived as any conviction on the subject.
      You must let me introduce you to some relatives of mine in Paris. They
      will be delighted to know you; for, as one of the <i>compagnie d'élite</i>,
      you might figure as a very respectable 'lion' for two, nay, three entire
      evenings. And you will have the <i>entrée</i> to the pleasantest house in
      Paris; they receive every evening, and all the best people resort there. I
      only exact one condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not make love to Pauline. That you will fall in love with her
      yourself is a fact I can't help,&mdash;nor you either. But no advance on
      your part; promise me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such case, Tascher, it were best for all parties I should not know the
      lady. I have no fancy, believe me, for being smitten whether I will or
      no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Master Burke, there is a bit of impertinence in all this. You
      sneer at my warnings about <i>la belle cousine</i>; now, I am determined
      you shall see her at least. Besides, you must do me a service with the
      countess I have had the bad luck to be for some time out of favor with my
      aunt Josephine,&mdash;some trumpery debts of mine they make a work about
      at the Tuileries. Well, perhaps you could persuade Madame de Lacostellerie
      to take up my cause; she has great influence with the Empress, and can
      make her do what she pleases. And, if I must confess it, it was this
      brought me over to your quarters tonight; and I ate your supper just to
      pass away time till you came back again. You 'll not refuse me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. But reflect for a moment, Tascher, and you will see that
      no man was ever less intended for a diplomate. It is only a few minutes
      since you laughed at my solitary habits and hermit propensities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've thought of all that, Burke, and am not a whit discouraged. On the
      contrary, you are the more likely to think of my affairs because you have
      none of your own; and I don't know any one but yourself I should fancy to
      meet Pauline frequently and on terms of intimacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, at least, is not a compliment,&rdquo; said I, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders, and threw up his eyebrows with a French
      expression, as though to say, it can't be helped; and then continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now remember, Burke, I count on you. Get me out of this confounded
      place; I 'd rather be back at Toulon again, if need be. And as I shall not
      see you again before you leave, farewell. I 'll send the letter for the
      countess early to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We shook hands warmly and parted: he to return to his quarters; and I to
      sit down beside my fire, and muse over the events that had just occurred,
      and think of Tascher himself, whose character had never been so plainly
      exposed to me before.
    </p>
    <p>
      If De Beauvais, with his hot-headed impetuosity, his mad devotion to the
      cause of the Legitimists, was a type of the followers of the Bourbons; so,
      in all the easy indifference and quiet selfishness of his nature, was
      Tascher a specimen of another class of his countrymen,&mdash;a class
      which, wrapped up in its own circle of egotistical enjoyments, believed
      Paris the only habitable spot of the whole globe. Without any striking
      traits of character, or any very decided vices, they led a life of
      pleasure and amusement, rendering every one and everything around them, so
      far as they were able, subservient to their own plane and wishes; and
      perfectly unconscious the while how glaring their selfishness had become,
      and how palpable, even to the least observant, was the self-indulgence
      they practised on every occasion. Without cleverness or tact enough to
      conceal their failings, they believed they imposed on others because they
      imposed on themselves,&mdash;just as the child deems himself unseen when
      he closes his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Josephine's followers were, many of them, like this, and formed a striking
      contrast to the young men of the Napoleonite party, who, infatuated by the
      glorious successes of their chief, deemed the career of arms alone
      honorable. St. Cyr and the Polytechnique were the nurseries of these,&mdash;the
      principles instilled there were perpetuated in after life; and however
      exaggerated their ideas of France and her destiny, their undoubted heroism
      and devotion might well have palliated even heavier errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in ruminating thus over the different characters of the few I had
      ever known intimately, that I came to think seriously on my own condition,
      which, for many a day before, I had rather avoided than sought to reflect
      on. I felt,&mdash;as how many must have done!&mdash;that the bond of a
      common country, the inborn patriotism of the native of the soil, is the
      great resource on which men fall back when they devote themselves to the
      career of arms; that the alien's position, disguise it how he will, is
      that of the mere mercenary. How can he identify himself with interests on
      which he is but half-informed, or feel attachment to a land wherein he has
      neither hearth nor home? In the very glory he wins he can scarce
      participate. In a word, his is a false position, which no events nor
      accidents of fortune can turn to good account, and he must rest satisfied
      with a life of isolation and estrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt how readily, if I had been a Frenchman born, I could have excused
      and palliated to my conscience many things which now were matters of
      reproach. Aggressive war had lost its horrors in the glory of enlarged
      dominions; the greatness of France and the honor of her arms had made me
      readily forget the miseries entailed on other nations by her lust of
      conquest. But I&mdash;the stranger, the alien&mdash;had no part in the
      inheritance of glory; and personal ambition,&mdash;what means it, save to
      stand high amongst those we once looked up to as superiors? For me there
      were no traditions of a childhood passed amid great names, revered and
      worshipped; no early teachings of illustrious examples beside the paternal
      hearth. And yet there was one, although lost to me forever, before whose
      eyes I would gladly seem to hold a high place. Yes! could I but think that
      she had not forgotten me,&mdash;would hear my name with interest, or feel
      one throb of pleasure if I were spoken of with honor,&mdash;I asked no
      more!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter, Monsieur le Capitaine,&rdquo; said my servant, as he deposited a
      package on my table. Supposing it was the epistle of which Tascher spoke,
      I paid but slight attention to it, when by chance I remarked it was in
      General d'Auvergne's handwriting. I opened it at once, and read as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      Bivouac, 11 o'clock.

      My dear Burke,&mdash;No one ever set off for Paris without being
      troubled with commissions for his country friends, and you
      must not escape the ills of common humanity. Happily for
      you, however, the debt is easily acquitted; I have neither
      undiscovered shades of silk to be matched, nor impossible
      bargains to be effected. I shall simply beg of you to
      deliver with your own hand the enclosed letter to its
      address at the Tuileries; adding, if you think fit, the
      civil attentions of a visit.

      We shall both, in all likelihood, be much hurried when we
      meet to-morrow,&mdash;for I also have received orders to march,&mdash;
      so that I take the present opportunity to enclose you a
      check on Paris for a trifle in advance of your pay;
      remembering too well, in my own aide-de-camp days, the
      dilatory habits of the War Office with new captains.

      Yours ever, dear Burke,

      D'Auvergne, Lieut-General.
</pre>
    <p>
      The letter of which he spoke had fallen on the table, where I now read the
      address,&mdash;&ldquo;À Madame la Comtesse d'Auvergne, née Comtesse de Meudon,
      dame d'honneur de S. M. l'Impératrice.&rdquo; As I read these lines, I felt my
      face grow burning hot, my cheeks flushed up, and I could scarcely have
      been more excited were I actually in her presence to whom the letter was
      destined. The poor general's kind note, his check for eight thousand
      francs, lay there: I forgot them both, and sat still, spelling over the
      letters of that name so woven in my destiny. I thought of the first night
      I had ever heard it, when, a mere boy, I wept over her sorrows, and
      grieved for her whose fate was so soon to throw its shadow over my own.
      But in a moment all gave way before the one thought,&mdash;I should see
      her again, speak to her and hear her voice. It is true, she was the wife
      of another: but as Marie de Meudon, our destinies were as wide apart;
      under no circumstances could she have been mine, nor did I ever dare to
      hope it. My love to her&mdash;for it was such, ardent and passionate&mdash;was
      more the devotion of some worshipper at a shrine than an affection that
      sought return. The friendless soldier of fortune, poor, unknown, uncared
      for,&mdash;how could he raise his thoughts to one for whose hand the
      noblest and the bravest were suitors in vain? Yet, with all this, how my
      heart throbbed to think that we should meet again! Nor was the thought
      less stirring that I felt, that even in the short interval of absence I
      had won praise from him for whom her admiration was equal to my own. With
      all the turmoil of my hopes and fears I felt a rush of pleasure at my
      heart; and when I slept, it was to dream of happy days to come, and a
      future far brighter than the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first thought when morning broke was to ride over to Beygern, to learn
      the fate of my wounded friends. On my way thither I fell in with several
      officers bound on a similar errand, for already the convent had become the
      great hospital to which the sufferers were brought from every part of the
      camp. As we went along, I was much struck by the depression of spirit so
      remarkable everywhere. The battle over, all the martial enthusiasm seemed
      to have evaporated: many grumbled at the tiresome prospect of a winter in
      country quarters, or cantoned in the field; some regretted the briefness
      of the campaign; while others again complained that to return to France
      after so little of active service would only expose them to ridicule from
      their companions who had seen Italy and Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare your sorrows on that score, my young friends,&rdquo; said a colonel, who
      listened patiently to the complaints around him; &ldquo;we shall not see the
      dome of the Invalides for some time yet. Except the <i>compagnie d'élite</i>,
      I fancy few of us will figure on the Boulevards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, again,&rdquo; cried another: &ldquo;I never heard anything so unfair as that
      <i>compagnie d'élite</i>; they have been, with two solitary exceptions,
      taken from the cavalry. Austerlitz was to be the day of honor for the
      infantry of France, said the bulletin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it was,&rdquo; interrupted a little dark-eyed major; &ldquo;and I suppose his
      Majesty thought we had enough of it on the field, and did not wish to
      surfeit us with glory. But I ask pardon,&rdquo; said he, turning towards me;
      &ldquo;monsieur is, if I mistake not, named one of the <i>élite</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I replied in the affirmative, I observed all eyes turned towards me;
      but not with any kindly expression,&mdash;far from it. I saw that there
      was a deliberate canvass of me, as though to see by my outward man how I
      could possibly deserve such a favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you explain to us, Monsieur,&rdquo; said the little major to me, &ldquo;on what
      principle the <i>élite</i> were chosen? For we have a thousand
      contradictory reports in the camp: some say by ballot; some, that it was
      only those who never soiled their jackets in the affair of the other day,
      and looked fresh and smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A burst of laughter from the rest interrupted the major's speech, for its
      impertinence was quite sufficient to secure it many admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, sir,&rdquo; said I, angrily, &ldquo;I can show you some reasons against
      the selection of certain persons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I got thus far, an officer whispered something into the major's ear,
      who, with a roar of laughing, exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons! ten thousand, <i>parbleu!</i> I did n't know you. It
      was monsieur pinked François, the maître d'armes? Yes, yes; don't deny
      it,&rdquo; said he, as I made no reply whatever to a question I believed quite
      irrelevant to the occasion,&mdash;&ldquo;don't deny it. That lunge over the
      guard was a thing to be proud of; and, by Jove! you shall not practise it
      at my expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech excited great amusement among the party, who seemed to
      coincide perfectly with the reasoning of the speaker; while I myself
      remained silent, unable to decide whether I ought to be annoyed or the
      reverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Monsieur,&rdquo; resumed the major, addressing me with courtesy, &ldquo;I
      ask-pardon for the liberty of my speech. By Saint Denis! if all the <i>compagnie
      d'élite</i> have the same skill of fence, I 'll not question their
      appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The candor of the avowal was too much for my gravity, and I now joined in
      the mirth of his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I have mentioned so trivial an incident as this here, it is because I
      wish to mark, even thus passingly, a trait of French military life. The
      singular confession of a man who regretted his impertinence because he
      discovered his adversary was a better swordsman, would, under any other
      code or in any other country, have argued poltroonery. Not so here; no one
      for a moment suspected his comrade's courage, nor could any circumstance
      arise to make it doubtful save an actual instance of cowardice. The
      inequality of the combat was reason enough for not engaging in it: the
      odds were unfair, because duelling was like a game where each party was to
      have an equal chance; and hence no shame was felt at declining a contest
      where this inequality existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a system, it is obvious, could not have prevailed in communities
      where duelling was only resorted to in extreme cases; but here it was an
      every-day occurrence, and often formed but a brief interval, scarce
      interrupting the current of an old friendship. Any resentful spirit, any
      long-continued dislike to the party with whom you once fought, would have
      been denounced as unofficer-like and ungenerous; and every day saw men
      walking arm-inarm in closest intimacy, who but the morning before stood
      opposed to each other's weapons. I now perceived the truth of what Minette
      had once said, and which at the time I but imperfectly comprehended.
      &ldquo;Maître François will be less troublesome in future; and you, Lieutenant,
      will have an easier life also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt there!&rdquo; shouted a sentry, as we approached the narrow causeway that
      led up to the convent. We now discovered, that by a general order no one
      was permitted to approach the hospital save such as were provided with a
      leave from the medical staff. A bulletin of the deaths was daily published
      on the guard-house, except which no other information was afforded of the
      condition of the wounded; and to this we turned eagerly, and with anxious
      hearts, lest we might read the name of some friend lost forever. I ran
      over with a rapid glance the list, where neither St. Hilaire nor poor
      Pioche occurred; and then, setting spurs to my horse, hurried back to my
      quarters at the top of my speed. When I arrived, the preparations for the
      departure of the <i>élite</i> were already in progress, and I had but time
      to make my few arrangements for the road when the order came to join my
      comrades.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. PARIS IN 1800
    </h2>
    <p>
      A portion of the Luxembourg was devoted to the reception of the <i>compagnie
      d'élite</i> for whom a household on the most liberal scale was provided, a
      splendid table maintained, and all that wealth and the taste of a
      voluptuous age could suggest, procured, to make their life one of daily
      magnificence and pleasure. Daru himself, the especial favorite of the
      Emperor, took the head of the table each day, to which generally some of
      the ministers were invited; while the &ldquo;Moniteur&rdquo; of every morning
      chronicled the festivities, giving <i>éclat</i> to the most minute
      circumstance, and making Paris re-echo to the glories of him of whose fame
      they were but the messengers. The most costly equipages, saddle-horses of
      great price, grooms in gorgeous liveries, all that could attract notice
      and admiration, were put in requisition; while ceremonies of pomp went
      forward day by day, and the deputation received in state the
      congratulatory visits of different departments of the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus this homage was paid to the semblance of Napoleon's glory, his
      progress through Germany was one grand triumphal procession. One day we
      read of his arrival at Munich, whither the Empress had gone to meet him.
      There he was welcomed with the most frantic enthusiasm: he had restored to
      them their army almost without loss, and covered with laurels; he had
      elevated their elector to a throne; while he cemented the friendship
      between the two nations by the marriage of Eugène Beauharnais with the
      Princess of Bavaria. Another account would tell us of sixteen thousand
      Russian prisoners on their way to France, accompanied by two thousand
      cannon taken from the Austrians. All that could excite national enthusiasm
      and gratify national vanity was detailed by the Government press, and
      popular excitement raised to a higher pitch than in the wildest periods of
      the Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hourly was his arrival looked forward to with anxiety and impatience.
      Fêtes on the most splendid scale of magnificence were in preparation, and
      the public bodies of Paris held meetings to concert measures for his
      triumphal reception. At last a telegraphic despatch announced his arrival
      at Strasburg. He crossed the Rhine at the very place where, exactly one
      hundred days before, he passed over on his march against the Austrians;
      one hundred days of such glory as not even his career had equalled,&mdash;Ulm
      and Austerlitz, vanquished Russia, and ruined Austria the trophies of this
      brief space! Never had his genius shone with greater splendor; never had
      Fortune shown herself 'more the companion of his destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each hour was now counted, and every thought turned to the day when he
      might be expected to arrive; and on the 24th came the intelligence that
      the Emperor was approaching Paris. He had halted part of a day at Nancy to
      review some regiments of cavalry, and now might be expected in less than
      twenty-four hours. The next morning all Paris awoke at an early hour; when
      what was the surprise and disappointment to see the great flag floating
      from the pavilion of the Tuileries! His Majesty had arrived during the
      night, when, at once sending for the Minister of Finance, he proceeded,
      without taking a moment's repose, to examine into the dreadful crisis
      which threatened the Bank of France and the very existence of the
      Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven, the Council of State were assembled at the Tuileries; and at
      twelve, a proclamation, dispersed through Paris, announced that M. Molien
      was appointed minister, and M. Marbois was dismissed from his office. The
      rapidity of these changes, and the avoidance of all public homage by the
      Emperor, threw for several days a cast of gloom over the whole city; which
      was soon dissipated by the reappearance of Napoleon, and the publication
      of that celebrated report by M. Champagny in which the glories of France&mdash;her
      victories, her acquisitions in wealth, territory, and influence&mdash;were
      recited in terms whose adulation it would be now difficult to digest.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment the festivities of Paris commenced, and with a splendor
      unsurpassed by any period of the Empire. It was the Augustan era of
      Napoleon's life in all that concerned the fine arts; for literature,
      unhappily, did not flourish at any time beneath his reign. Gérard and
      Gros, David, Ingres, and Isabey committed to canvas the glories of the
      German campaigns; and the capitulation of Ulm, the taking of Vienna, the
      passage of the Danube, and the field of Austerlitz still live in the
      genius of these great painters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Opera, too, under the direction of Gimerosa, had attained to an
      unwonted excellence; while Spontini and Boieldieu, in their separate
      walks, gave origin to the school so distinctly that of the Comic Opera.
      Still, the voluptuous tastes of the day prevailed above all; and the
      ballet, and the strange conceptions of Nicolo, a Maltese composer,&mdash;in
      which music, dancing, romance, and scenery all figured,&mdash;were the
      passion of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dancing was, indeed, the great art of the era. Vestris and Trénis were the
      great names in every <i>salon</i>; and all the extravagant graces and
      voluptuous groupings of the ballet were introduced into the amusements of
      society: even the taste in dress was made subordinate to this passion,&mdash;the
      light and floating materials, which mark the figure and display symmetry,
      replacing the heavier and more costly robes of former times. The reaction
      to the stern puritanism of the Republican age had set in, and secretly was
      favored by Napoleon himself; who saw in all this extravagance and
      abandonment to pleasure the basis of that new social state on which he
      purposed to found his dynasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never were the entertainments at the Tuileries more costly; never was a
      greater magnificence displayed in all the ceremonial of state. The
      marshals of the Empire were enjoined to maintain a style corresponding to
      their exalted position; and the reports of the police were actually
      studied respecting such persons as lived in what was deemed a manner
      unbefitting their means of expense. Cambacérès and Fouché, Talleyrand and
      Murat, all maintained splendid establishments. Their dinners were given
      twice each week, and their receptions were almost every evening. If the
      Emperor conferred wealth with a liberal hand, so did he expect to see it
      freely expended. He knew well the importance of conciliating the
      affections of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> of Paris; and that by no other means
      could such an end be accomplished more readily than by a lavish
      expenditure of money throughout all classes of society. This was alone
      wanting to efface every trace of the old Republican spirit. The simple
      habits and uncostly tastes of the Jacobins were at once regarded as
      meannesses; their frugal and unpretending modes of life pronounced low and
      vulgar; and many, who could have opposed a stout heart against the current
      of popular feeling on stronger grounds, yielded to the insinuations and
      mockeries of their own class, and conformed to tastes which eventually
      engendered opinions and even principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ask pardon of my reader for digressing from the immediate subject of my
      own career, to speak of topics which are rather the province of the
      historian than a mere story-teller like myself; still, I should not be
      able to present to his view the picture of manners I desired, without thus
      recalling some features of that time, so pregnant with the fate of Europe
      and the future destiny of France. And now to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately on the Emperor's arrival, the Empress and her suite took their
      departure for Versailles; from whence it was understood they were not to
      return before the end of the month, for which time a splendid ball was
      announced at the Tuileries. Unwilling to detain General d'Auvergne's
      letter so long, and unable from the position I occupied to obtain leave of
      absence from Paris, I forwarded the letter to the comtesse, and abandoned
      the only hope of meeting her once more. The disappointment from this
      source; the novelty of the circumstances in which I found myself; the
      fascinations of a world altogether strange to me,&mdash;all conspired to
      confuse and excite me, and I entered into the dissipation of those around
      me, if not with all their zest, at least with as headlong a resolution to
      drown all reflection in a life of voluptuous enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only person of my own standing among the <i>compagnie d'élite</i> was
      a captain of the Chasseurs of the Guard, who, although but a few years my
      senior, had seen service in the Italian campaign. By family a Bour-bonist,
      he joined the revolutionary armies when his relatives fled from France,
      and slowly won his steps to his present rank. A certain <i>hauteur</i> in
      his manner with men&mdash;an air of distance he always wore&mdash;had made
      him as little liked by them as it usually succeeds in making a man popular
      with women, to whom the opposite seems at once a compliment. He was a man
      who had seen much of the world, and in the best society; gifted with the
      most fascinating address, whenever he pleased to exert it, and singularly
      good-looking, he was the <i>beau idéal</i> of the French officer of the
      highest class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier Duchesne and myself had travelled together for some days
      without exchanging more than the ordinary civilities of distant
      acquaintance, when some accident of the road threw us more closely
      together, and ended by forming an intimacy which, in our Paris life,
      brought us every hour into each other's society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stranger as I was in the capital, to me the acquaintance was a boon of
      great price. He knew it thoroughly: in the gorgeous and stately <i>salons</i>
      of the Faubourg; in the <i>guingettes</i> of the Rue St. Denis; in the
      costly mansion of the modern banker (the new aristocracy of the land); or
      in the homely <i>ménage</i> of the shopkeeper of the Rue St. Honoré,&mdash;he
      was equally at home, and by some strange charm had the <i>entrée</i> too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same &ldquo;sesame&rdquo; opened to him the <i>coulisse</i> of the Opera and the
      penetralia of the Français. In fact, he seemed one of those privileged
      people who are met with occasionally in life in places the most
      incongruous and with acquaintances the most opposite, yet never carrying
      the prestige of the one or the other an inch beyond the precincts it
      belongs to. Had he been wealthy I could have accounted for much of this,
      for never was there a period when riches more abounded nor when their
      power was more absolute: but he did not seem so; although in no want of
      money, his retinue and simple style of living betrayed nothing beyond fair
      competence. Neither, as far as I could perceive, did he incline to habits
      of extravagance; on the contrary, he was too apt to connect every display
      with vulgarity, and condemn in his fastidiousness the gorgeous splendor
      that characterized the period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, without going further, did Duchesne appear to be, as we took up our
      quarters at the Luxembourg, and commenced an intimacy which each day
      served to increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thank Heaven, this vaudeville is over at last!&rdquo; said he, as he
      threw himself into a large chair at my fire, and pitched his chapeau, all
      covered with gold and embroidery, into a far corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had just returned from Notre Dame, where the grand ceremonial of
      receiving the standards was held by the Senate with all the solemnity of a
      high mass and the most imposing observances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vaudeville?&rdquo; said I, turning round rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; what else can you call it? What, I ask you, had those poor decrepit
      senators, those effeminate priests in the costumes of <i>béguines</i>, to
      do with the eagles of a brave but unfortunate army? In what way can you
      connect that incense and that organ with the smoke of artillery and the
      crash of mitraille? And, lastly, was it like old Daru himself to stand
      there, half crouching, beside some wretched half-palsied priest? But I
      feel heartily ashamed of myself, though I played but the smallest part in
      the whole drama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it thus you can speak of the triumph of our army? the glories&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistake me much. I only speak of that miserable mockery which
      converts our hard-won laurels into chap-lets of artificial flowers. These
      displays are far beneath us, and would only become the victories of some
      national guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then,&rdquo; said I, half laughingly, &ldquo;it is your Republican gorge that
      rises against all this useless ceremonial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the very first ever detected me in that guise,&rdquo; said he, bursting
      into a hearty laugh. &ldquo;But come, I'd wager you agree with me all this
      while. This was a very contemptible exhibition; and, for my own part, I 'd
      rather see the colors back again with those poor fellows we chased at
      Austerlitz, than fluttering in the imbecile hands of dotage and bigotry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must say we differ totally. I like to think of the warlike spirit
      nourished in a nation by the contemplation of such glorious spoils. I am
      young enough to remember how the Invalides affected me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you took your Sunday walk there from the Poly-technique, two and
      two, with a blue ribbon round your neck for being a good boy during the
      week. Oh, I know it all; delicious times they were, with their souvenirs
      of wooden legs and plum-pudding. Happy fellow you must be, if the delusion
      can last this while!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are determined it shall not continue much longer,&rdquo; said I, laughing;
      &ldquo;that is quite evident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; on the contrary, I shall be but too happy to be your convert, instead
      of making you mine. But unfortunately, Sa Majesté, Empereur et Roi, has
      taught me some smart lessons since I gave up mathematics; and I have
      acquired a smattering of his own policy, which is to look after the
      substance, and leave the shadow&mdash;or the <i>drapeau</i>, if you like
      it better&mdash;to whoever pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess, however,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I don't well understand your enthusiasm
      about war and your indifference about its trophies. To me the associations
      they suggest are pleasurable beyond anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I remember something of that kind in myself formerly,&rdquo; said he,
      musing. &ldquo;There was a time when the blast of a trumpet, or even the clank
      of a sabre, used to set my heart thumping. Happily, however, the organ has
      grown steeled against even more stirring sounds; and I listened to the
      salute to-day, fired as it was by that imposing body, the artillery of the
      'Garde Nationale,' with an equanimity truly wonderful. Apropos, my dear
      Burke; talk of heroism and self-devotion as you will, but show me anything
      to compare with the gallantry of those fellows we saw to-day on the Quai
      Voltaire,&mdash;a set of grocers, periwig-makers, umbrella and sausage
      men, with portly paunches and spectacles,&mdash;ramming down charges,
      sponging, loading, and firing real cannon. On my word of honor, it was
      fearful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say his Majesty is very proud indeed of the National Guard of
      Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is. Look at them, and just think what must be the enthusiasm
      of men who will adopt a career so repugnant, not only to their fancy, but
      their very formation. Remember that he who runs yonder with a twenty-four
      pounder never handled anything heavier than a wig-block, and that the only
      charges of the little man beside him have been made in his day-book. By
      Saint Denis! the dromedary guard we had in Egypt were more at home in
      their saddles than the squadron who rode beside the archbishop's
      carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is scarcely fair, after all,&rdquo; said I, half laughing, &ldquo;to criticise
      them so severely; and the more, as I think you had some old acquaintances
      among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! you saw that, did you?&rdquo; said he, smiling. &ldquo;No, by Jove! I never met
      them before. But that <i>confrèrie</i> of soldiers&mdash;you understand&mdash;soon
      made us acquainted; and I saw one old fellow speaking to a very pretty
      girl I guessed to be his daughter, and soon cemented a small friendship
      with him: here's his card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His card! Why, are you to visit him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better again; I shall dine there on Monday next. Let us see how he calls
      himself: 'Hippolyte Pierrot, stay and corset-maker to her Majesty the
      Empress, No. 22 Rue du Bac,&mdash;third floor above the <i>entresol.</i>'
      <i>Diable!</i> we 're high up. Unfortunately, I am scarcely intimate
      enough to bring a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, make no excuses on that head,&rdquo; said I, laughing; &ldquo;I really have no
      desire to see Monsieur Hippolyte Pierrot's <i>menage</i>. And now, what
      are your engagements for this evening? Are you for the Opera?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't well know,&rdquo; said he, pausing. &ldquo;Madame Caulaincourt receives, and
      of course expects to see our gay jackets in her <i>salon</i> any time
      before or after supper. Then there's the Comtesse de Nevers: I never go
      there without meeting my tailor; the fellow's a spy of the police, and a
      confectioner to boot, and he serves the ices, and reports the
      conversations in the Place Vendôme and that side of the Rue St. Honoré,&mdash;I
      couldn't take a glass of lemonade without being dunned. Then, in the
      Faubourg I must go in plain clothes,&mdash;they would not let the 'livery
      of the Usurper' pass the porter's lodge; besides, they worry one with
      their enthusiastic joy or grief,&mdash;as the last letter from England
      mentions whether the Comte d'Artois has eaten too many oysters, or found
      London beer too strong for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From all which I guess that you are indisposed to stir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that is about the fact. Truth is, Burke, there is only one
      soirée in all Paris I 'd take the trouble to dress for this evening; and,
      strange enough, it's the only house where I don't know the people. He is a
      commissary-general, or a 'fournisseur' of some kind or other of the army;
      always from home, they say; with a wife who was once, and a daughter who
      is now, exceeding pretty; keeps a splendid house; and, like an honest man,
      makes restitution of all he can cheat in the campaign by giving good
      dinners in the capital. His Majesty, at the solicitation of the Empress, I
      believe, made him a count,&mdash;God's mercy it was not a king!&mdash;and
      as they come from Guadaloupe, or Otaheite, no one disputes their right.
      Besides, this is not a time for such punctilio. This is all I know of
      them, for unfortunately they settled here since I joined the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a very plausible name, I assure you. Lacostellerie,&mdash;Madame la
      Comtesse de Lacostellerie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! you remind me I have letters for her,&mdash;a circumstance I had
      totally forgotten, though it was coupled with a commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter! Why, nothing was ever so fortunate. Don't lose a moment; you
      have just time to leave it, with your card, before dinner. You'll have an
      invitation for this evening at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have not the slightest wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, <i>I</i> have; and you shall bring me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; said I, mimicking his own words, &ldquo;I am unfortunately not
      intimate enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;there is a vast difference between the
      etiquette Rue du Bac, No. 22, three floors above the <i>entresol</i>, and
      the gorgeous <i>salons</i> of the Hôtel Clichy, Rue Faubourg St. Honoré;
      ceremony has the advantage in the former by a height of three pair of
      stairs, not to speak of the <i>entresol</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't know the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how am I to present you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily enough,&mdash;'Captain Duchesne, Imperial Guard;' or, if you
      prefer it, I 'll do the honors for <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart, then,&rdquo; said I, laughing; and pre-pared to pay the
      visit in question.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE HÔTEL DE CLICHY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Duchesne was correct in all his calculations. I had scarcely reached the
      Luxembourg when a valet brought me a card for the comtesse's soirée for
      that evening. It was accordingly agreed upon that we were to go together;
      I as the invited, he as my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All your finery, Burke, remember that,&rdquo; said he, as we separated to
      dress. &ldquo;The uniform of the <i>compagnie d'élite</i> is as much a
      decoration in a <i>salon</i> as a camellia or a geranium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he re-entered my room half an hour later, I was struck by the blaze
      of orders and decorations with which his jacket was covered; while at his
      side there hung a magnificent <i>sabre d'honneur</i>, such as the Emperor
      was accustomed to confer on his most distinguished officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You smile at all this bravery,&rdquo; said he, wilfully misinterpreting my look
      of admiration; &ldquo;but remember where we are going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; interrupted I; &ldquo;but it is the first time I knew you had
      the cross of the Legion.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i>&rdquo; said he, with an insolent shrug of his shoulders, &ldquo;I had
      lent it to my hairdresser for a ball at the 'Cirque.' But here comes the
      carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While we drove along towards the Faubourg I had time to learn some further
      particulars of the people to whose house we were proceeding; and for my
      reader's information may as well impart them here, with such other facts
      as I subsequently collected myself.

      Like most of the <i>salons</i> of the new aristocracy, Madame
      Lacostellerie received people of every section of party and every class of
      political opinion. Standing equally aloof from the old régime and the
      members of the Jacobin party, her receptions were a kind of neutral
      territory, where each could come without compromise of dignity: for
      already, except among the most starched adherents of the Bourbons, few of
      whom remained in France, there was a growing spirit to side with the
      Napoleonists in preference to the revolutionary section; while the latter,
      with all their pretensions to simplicity and primitive tastes, felt no
      little pride in mixing with the very aristocracy they so loudly inveighed
      against. Besides all this, wealth had its prestige. Never, in the palmiest
      days of the royalty, were entertainments of greater splendor; and the
      Legitimists, however disposed to be critical on the company, could afford
      to be just regarding the cuisine,&mdash;the luxury of these modern dinners
      eclipsing the most costly displays of former times, where hereditary rank
      and ancient nobility contributed to adorn the scene. And, lastly, the
      admixture of every grade and class extended the field of conversational
      agreeability, throwing in new elements and eliciting new features in a
      society where peers, actors, poets, bankers, painters, soldiers,
      speculators, journalists, and adventurers were confusedly mixed together;
      making, as it were, a common fund of their principles and their
      prejudices, and starting anew in life with what they could seize in the
      scramble.

      After following the long line of carriages for above an hour, we at last
      turned into a large courtyard, lit up almost to the brightness of day.
      Here the equipages of many of the ministers were standing,&mdash;a
      privilege accorded to them above the other guests. I recognized among the
      number the splendid liveries of Decrès; and the stately carriage of
      Talleyrand, whose household always proclaimed itself as belonging to a
      &ldquo;seigneur&rdquo; of the oldest blood of France,&mdash;the most perfect type of a
      highbred gentleman. Our progress from the vestibule to the stairs was a
      slow one. The double current of those pressing upwards and downwards
      delayed us long; and at last we reached a spacious antechamber, where even
      greater numbers stood awaiting their turn, if happily it should come, to
      move forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      While here, the names of those announced conveyed tous a fair impression
      of the whole company. Among the first was Le General Junot, Berthollet
      (the celebrated chemist), Lafayette, Monges, Daru, Comte de Mailles (a
      Legitimist noble), David (the regicide), the Ambassador of Prussia, M.
      Pasquier, Talma. Such were the names we heard following in quick
      succession; when suddenly an avenue was opened by a master of the
      ceremonies before me, who read from my card the words, &ldquo;Le Capitaine
      Burke, officier d'élite; le Chevalier Duchesne, présenté par lui.&rdquo; And
      advancing within the doorway, I found myself opposite a very handsome
      woman, whose brilliant dress and blaze of diamonds concealed any ravages
      time might have made upon her beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conversing with the Arch-Chancellor, Cambacérès, when my name was
      announced; and turning rapidly round, touched my arm with her bouquet, as
      she said, with a most gracious smile,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am but too much flattered to see you on so short an invitation; but M.
      de Tascher's note led me to hope I might presume so far. Your friend, I
      believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have taken the great liberty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Madame la Comtesse,&rdquo; said Duchesne, interrupting, &ldquo;I must
      exculpate my friend here. This intrusion rests on my own head, and has no
      other apology than my long cherished wish to pay my homage to the most
      distinguished ornament of the Parisian world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the quiet flow of his words, and the low deferential bow with
      which he accompanied them, completely divested his speech of its tone of
      gross flattery, and merely made it seem a very fitting and appropriate
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This would be a very high compliment, indeed,&rdquo; replied Madame de
      Lacostellerie, with a flush of evident pleasure on her cheek, &ldquo;had it even
      come from one less known than the Chevalier Duchesne. I hope the Duchesse
      de Montserrat is well,&mdash;your aunt, if I mistake not?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Madame,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;in excellent health; it will afford her great pleasure when I
      inform her of your polite inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another announcement now compelled us to follow the current in front,
      which I was well content to do, and escape from an interchange of fine
      speeches, of whose sincerity, on one side at least, I had very strong
      misgivings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then, the comtesse is acquainted with your family?&rdquo; said I, in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said so?&rdquo; replied he, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she not ask after the Duchesse de Montserrat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And didn't you promise to convey her very kind message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I did. But are you simple enough to think that either of us
      were serious in what we said? Why, my dear friend, she never saw my aunt
      in her life; nor, if I were to hint at her inquiry for her to the
      duchesse, am I certain it would not cost me something like a half million
      of francs the old lady has left me in her will,&mdash;on my word, I firmly
      believe she'd never forgive it. You know little what these people of the
      <i>vieille roche</i>, as they call themselves, are like. Do you see that
      handsome fellow yonder, with a star on a blue cordon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know him; but I see he's a Marshal of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I saw that same aunt of mine rise up and leave the room because <i>he</i>
      sat down in her presence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that was intolerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she deemed his insolence. Come, move on; they 're dancing in the next
      <i>salon</i>.&rdquo; And without saying more, we pushed through the crowd in the
      direction of the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only by referring to the sensations experienced by those who see a
      ballet at the Opera for the first time that I can at all convey my own on
      entering the <i>salle de danse</i>. My first feeling was that of absolute
      shame. Never before had I seen that affectation of stage costume which
      then was the rage in society. The short and floating jupe&mdash;formed of
      some light and gauzy texture, which, even where it covered the figure,
      betrayed the form and proportions of the wearer&mdash;was worn low on the
      bosom and shoulders, and attached at the waist by a ribbon, whose knot
      hung negligently down in seeming disorder. The hair fell in long and
      floating masses loose upon the neck, waving in free tresses with every
      motion of the figure, and adding to that air of abandon which seemed so
      studiously aimed at. But more than anything in mere costume was the look
      and expression, in which a character of languid voluptuousness was
      written, and made to harmonize with the easy grace of floating movements,
      and sympathize with gestures full of passionate fascination.

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Burke,&rdquo; said Duchesne, as he threw his eyes over the room, &ldquo;shall I
      find a partner for you? for I believe I know most of the people here. That
      pretty blonde yonder, with the diamond buckles in her shoes, is
      Mademoiselle de Rancy, with a dowry of some millions of francs; what say
      you to pushing your fortune there? Don't forget the <i>officier d'élite</i>
      is a trump card just now; and there's no time to lose, for there will soon
      be a new deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if she had the throne of France in reversion,&rdquo; said I; turning away
      in disgust from a figure which, though perfectly beautiful, outraged at
      every movement that greatest charm of womanhood,&mdash;her inborn modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then, you don't fancy a blonde!&rdquo; said he, carelessly, whether
      wilfully misunderstanding me or not I could not say. &ldquo;Nor I either,&rdquo; added
      he. &ldquo;There, now, is something far more to my taste; is she not a lovely
      girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She to whom he now directed my attention was standing at the side of the
      room, and leaning on her partner's arm; her head slightly turned, so that
      we could not see her features, but her figure was actually faultless. Hers
      was not one of those gossamer shapes which flitted around and about us,
      balancing on tiptoe, or gracefully floating with extending arms. Rather
      strongly built than otherwise, she stood with the firm foot and the
      straight ankle of a marble statue; her arms, well rounded, hung easily
      from her full, wide shoulders; while her head, slightly thrown back, was
      balanced on her neck with an air at once dignified and easy. Her dress
      well suited the character of her figure: it was entirely of black, covered
      with a profusion of deep lace,&mdash;the jupe looped up in Andalusian
      fashion to display the leg, whose symmetry was perfect. Even her costume,
      however, had something about it too theatrical for my taste; but there was
      a stamp of firmness, <i>fierté</i> even, in her carriage and her attitude,
      that at once showed hers was no vulgar desire of being remarkable, but the
      womanly consciousness of being dressed as became her. She suddenly turned
      her head around, and we both exclaimed in the same breath, &ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo;
       Her features were of that brilliant character only seen in Southern blood:
      eyes large, black, and lustrous, fringed with lashes that threw their
      shadow on the very cheek; full lips, curled with an air of almost saucy
      expression; while the rich olive tint of her transparent skin was scarce
      colored with the pink flush of exercise, and harmonized perfectly with the
      proud repose of her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be Spanish,&mdash;that's certain,&rdquo; said Duchesne. &ldquo;No one ever
      saw such an instep come from this side the Pyrenees; and those eyes have
      got their look of sleepy wickedness from Moorish blood. But here comes one
      will tell us all about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the Baron de Trève,&mdash;a withered-looking, dried-up old man,
      rouged to the eyes, and dressed in the extravagance of the last fashion;
      the high collar of his coat rising nearly to the back of his head, as his
      deep cravat in front entirely concealed his mouth, and formed a kind of
      barrier around his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Duchesne addressed him, he stopped short, and assuming an attitude of
      great intended grace, raised his glass slowly to his eye, and looked
      towards the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the señorina. Don't you know <i>her?</i> Why, where have you been, my
      dear chevalier? Oh! I forgot. You've been in Austria, or Russia, or some
      barbarous place or other. She is the belle, <i>par excellence</i>; nothing
      else is talked of in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her name? Who is she?&rdquo; said Duchesne, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Lacostellerie, the daughter of the house,&rdquo; said the
      baron, completely overcome with astonishment at our ignorance. &ldquo;And you
      not to know this!&mdash;you, of all men living! Why,&rdquo; he continued,
      dropping his voice to a lower key, &ldquo;there never was such a fortune. Mines
      of rubies and emeralds; continents of coffee, rice, and sandal-wood; spice
      islands and sugar plantations, to make one's mouth water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, Baron! you seem somewhat susceptible yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had my thoughts on the subject,&rdquo; said he, with a half sigh. &ldquo;But, <i>hélas!</i>
      there are so many ties to be broken! so many tender chains one must snap
      asunder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Duchesne, with an air of well-assumed seriousness;
      &ldquo;the thing was impossible. Now, then, what say you to assist a friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&mdash;yourself, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Baron; no other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; said the old man, taking him by the arm, and leading him
      along to another part of the room, while Duchesne, with a sly look at me,
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I stood awaiting his return, my thoughts became fixed on Duchesne
      himself, of whose character I never felt free from my misgivings. The cold
      indifference he manifested on ordinary occasions to everything and
      everybody, I now saw could give way to strong impetuosity; but even this
      might be assumed also. As I pondered thus, I had not remarked that the
      dance was concluded; and already the dancers were proceeding towards their
      seats, when I heard my name uttered beside me,&mdash;&ldquo;Capitaine Burke.&rdquo; I
      turned; it was the countess herself, leaning on the arm of her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to present you to my daughter,&rdquo; said she, with a courteous smile.
      &ldquo;The college friend and brother officer of your cousin Tascher, Pauline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady courtesied with an air of cold reserve; I bowed deeply
      before her; while the countess continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hope to have the pleasure of seeing you frequently during your stay in
      Paris, when we shall have a better opportunity of making your
      acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I expressed my sense of this politeness, I turned to address a few
      words to mademoiselle; and requesting to have the honor of dancing with
      her, she looked at me with an air of surprise, as though not understanding
      my words, when suddenly the countess interposed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that my daughter's engagements have been made long since; but
      another night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before I could say more, the countess addressed another person near
      her, and mademoiselle, turning her head superciliously away, did not deign
      me any further attention; so that, abashed and awkward at so unfavorable a
      <i>début</i> in the gay world, I fell back, and mixed with the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I did so, I found myself among a group of officers, one of whom was
      relating an anecdote just then current in Paris, and which I mention
      merely as illustrating in some measure the habits of the period.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the levée of the Emperor on the morning before, an old general of
      brigade advanced to pay his respects, when Napoleon observed some drops of
      rain glistening on the embroidery of his uniform. He immediately turned
      towards one of his suite, and gave orders to ascertain by what carriage
      the general had arrived. The answer was, that he had come in a <i>fiacre</i>,&mdash;a
      hired vehicle, which by the rules of the Court was not admitted within the
      court of the Tuileries, and thus he was obliged to walk above one hundred
      yards before he could obtain shelter. The old officer, who knew nothing of
      the tender solicitude of the Emperor, was confounded with astonishment to
      observe at his departure a handsome <i>calèche</i> and two splendid horses
      at his service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose carriage is this?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, Monsieur le Général.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the servant, and the horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, also. His Majesty has graciously been pleased to order them for
      you; and desires you will remember that the sum of six thousand francs
      will be deducted from your pay to meet the cost of the equipage which the
      Emperor deems befitting your rank in the service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is thus,&rdquo; said the narrator, &ldquo;the Emperor would enforce that
      liberality on others he so eminently displays himself. The spoils of Italy
      and Austria are destined, not to found a new <i>noblesse</i>, but to
      enrich the <i>bourgeoisie</i> of this good city of Paris. I say, Edward,
      is not that Duchesne yonder? I thought he was above patronizing the <i>salons</i>
      of a mere commissary-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know the chevalier,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;no game flies too high
      or too low for his mark. Depend upon it, he's not here for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If mademoiselle be the object,&rdquo; said a third, &ldquo;I'll swear he shall have
      no rivalry on my side. By Jove I I 'd rather face a charge of Hulans than
      speak to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If thou wert a Marshal of France, Claude, thou wouldst think
      differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were a Marshal of France,&rdquo; repeated he, with energy, &ldquo;I'd rather
      marry Minette, the vivandière of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no bad choice either,&rdquo; broke in a large! heavy-looking officer.
      &ldquo;There is but one objection to such an arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that, if I might ask&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple enough. She would n't have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man endeavored to join in the laugh this speech excited among
      the rest, though it was evident he felt ill at ease from the ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons, my dear Burke,&rdquo; said Duchesne, at this moment, as he
      slipped his arm through mine; &ldquo;but I thought I should have been in need of
      your services a few minutes ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move a little aside, and I 'll tell you. I wished to ask mademoiselle to
      dance, and approached her for the purpose. She was standing with a number
      of people, all strangers to me, at the doorway yonder,&mdash;Dobretski,
      that Russian prince, the only man I knew amongst them. A very chilling
      'Engaged, sir,' was the answer of the lady to my first request. The same
      reply met my second and third; when the Russian, as if desirous to
      increase the awkwardness of my position, interposed with, 'And the fourth
      set mademoiselle dances with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'In that case,' said I, 'I may fairly claim the fifth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'On what grounds, sir?' said she, with a look of easy impertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The Emperor's orders, Mademoiselle,' said I, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Indeed, sir! May I ask how and when?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Austerlitz, December 2. The order of four o'clock, dated from Reygern,
      says, &ldquo;The Imperial Guard will follow closely on the track of the
      Russians.&rdquo; (Signed) &ldquo;Napoleon.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'In that case, sir,' said she, 'I cannot dispute his Majesty's orders. I
      shall dance the fifth with you.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Russian,&mdash;what said he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> I paid no attention to him; for as mademoiselle moved off
      with her partner, I strolled away in search of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If I was amused at this recital of the chevalier, I could not avoid
      feeling piqued at the greater success he had than myself; for still the
      chilling reception I had met with was rankling in my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us move away from this quarter,&rdquo; said Duchesne. &ldquo;Here we have got
      ourselves among a knot of old campaigners, with their stupid stories of
      Cairo and Acre, Alexandria and the Adige. By Jove! if anything would make
      me a Legitimist, it is my disgust at those confounded narratives about
      Kleber and Desaix; the Emperor himself does not despise the time of the
      Revolution more heartily than I do. Come, there's <i>bouillotte</i>
      yonder; let us go and win some pieces. I feel I'm in vein; and even to
      lose would be better than listen to these people. It was only a few
      minutes ago I was hunted, away from Madame de Muraire by old Berthollet,
      who is persuading her that her diamonds are but charcoal, and that a
      necklace is only fit to roast an ortolan. This comes of letting savants
      into society; decidedly, they had much better taste in the time of the
      Monarchy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with some difficulty we succeeded in approaching the <i>bouillotte</i>
      table, where, to judge from the stakes, very high play was going forward.
      Duchesne was quickly recognized among the players, who made place for him
      among them. I soon saw that he was not mistaken in supposing he was in
      luck; every <i>coup</i> was successful, and, while he continued to win
      time after time, the heap of gold grew greater, till it covered the part
      of the table before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly, Burke,&rdquo; said he, in a whisper, &ldquo;this is a strong turn of
      Fortune, who, being a woman, won't long be of the same mind. Five thousand
      francs,&rdquo; cried he, throwing the <i>billet de banque</i> carelessly before
      him, while he turned to resume what he was saying to me. &ldquo;Were I in action
      now, I 'd win the <i>bâton de maréchal</i>. I feel it; there's an innate
      sense of luck when it means to be steady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chevalier Duchesne! the Chevalier Duchesne!&rdquo; was repeated from voice
      to voice, outside the circle; &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Lacostellerie is waiting to
      waltz with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons,&rdquo; said he, rising. &ldquo;Burke, continue my game, while I
      try if I can't push fortune the whole way.&rdquo; So saying, and without
      listening to my excuses about ignorance of play, he pressed me into his
      seat, and pushed his way through the crowd to join the dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only when the players asked me if I intended to go on that I was
      aware of the position in which I found myself. I knew little more of the
      game than I had learned in looking over the table; but I was aware of the
      strict etiquette in all the play of society, which enjoins a revenge to
      every loser, so that I continued to bet and stake for Duchesne as I had
      seen him do already,&mdash;not, however, with such fortune. He had
      scarcely left the table when luck changed; and now I saw his riches
      decreasing even more rapidly than they had been accumulated. At last,
      after a long run of ill fortune, when I had staked a very large sum on the
      board, just as the banker was about to begin, I changed my mind and
      withdrew half of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&mdash;let it stay,&rdquo; whispered a voice in my ear; &ldquo;the sooner this
      is over the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned. It was Duchesne himself, who for some time had been seated
      behind my chair and looking on at the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleeting as was the glance I had of his features, I fancied they were
      somewhat paler than usual. Could this be from the turn of fortune? But no.
      I watched him now, and I perceived that he never even looked at the game.
      At last, I staked all that remained in one <i>coup</i>, and lost; when,
      drawing forth my own purse, I was about to make another bet,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Burke,&rdquo; whispered he in my ear; &ldquo;I was only waiting for this
      moment. Let us come away now. I rise as I sat down, Messieurs,&rdquo; he said,
      gayly; while he added, in a lower tone, &ldquo;Sauf l'honneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had enough of gayety for one night?&rdquo; said he, as he drew my arm
      within his. &ldquo;Shall we turn home wards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said I; for somehow I felt chagrined and vexed at my
      ill-luck, and was angry with myself for playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then; this door will bring us to the stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we passed along hastily through the crowd, I saw that a young officer
      in a hussar uniform whispered something in Duchesne's ear; to which he
      quickly replied, &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; And as he spoke again in the same low tone,
      Duchesne answered, &ldquo;Agreed, sir,&rdquo; with a courteous smile, and a look of
      much pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Burke,&rdquo; said he, turning to me, &ldquo;these are about the most splendid
      <i>salons</i> in Paris; I think I never saw more perfect taste. I
      certainly must thank you for being my chaperon here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, Duchesne, the Duchesse de Montserrat, it seems,&rdquo; said I,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, and so I had!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yet the initiative lay with you; how
      the termination may be is another matter,&rdquo; added he, in a mumbling voice,
      not intended to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; said I, puzzled what to say, and feeling I should say
      something, &ldquo;I am happy your Russian friend took no notice of your speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; said he, with a peculiar smile,&mdash;&ldquo;and why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I abhor a duel, in the first place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear boy, that speech smacks much more of the École de Jésuites
      than of St. Cyr. Don't let any one less your friend than I am hear you say
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not who may hear it. Necessity may make me meet an adversary in
      single combat; but as to acting the cold-blooded part of a bystander&mdash;as
      to being the witness of my friend's crime, or his own death&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come; when you exchange the dolman for an alb I 'll listen to this
      from you, if I can listen to it from any one. But happily, now we have no
      time for more morality, for here comes the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatting pleasantly about the soirée and its company, we rolled along
      towards our quarters, and parted with a cordial shake of the hand for the
      night.

      CHAPTER XI. A SALLE DE POLICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I entered the breakfast-room the following morning, I found Duchesne
      stretched before the fire in an easy-chair, busily engaged in reading the
      &ldquo;Moniteur&rdquo; of that day, where a long list of imperial <i>ordonnances</i>
      filled nearly three columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here have I been,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;conning over this catalogue of princely
      favor these twenty minutes, and yet cannot discern one word of our
      well-beloved cousins Captains Burke and Duchesne. And yet there seems to
      be a hailstorm of promotions. Some of them have got grand duchies; some
      principalities; some have the cross of the Legion; and here, by Jove! are
      some endowed with wives. Now that his Majesty has taken to christening and
      marrying, I suppose we shall soon see him administering all the succors of
      Holy Church. Have you much interest in hearing that Talleyrand is to be
      called Prince of Benevente, and Murat is now Grand-Duke of Berg,&mdash;that
      Sebastiani is to be married to Mademoiselle de Coigny, and Monsieur
      Decazes, <i>fils de</i> M. Decazes, has taken some one else to wife? Oh
      dear, oh dear! It's all very tiresome, and not even the fête of Saint
      Napoleon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of whom?&rdquo; said I, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint Napoleon, <i>parbleu!</i> It's no joking matter, I assure you. Here
      is the letter of the cardinal legate to the arch-bishops and bishops of
      France, commanding that the first Sunday in the August of each year should
      be set apart to celebrate his saintship, with an account of the
      processions to take place, and various plenary indulgences to the pious
      who shall present themselves on the occasion. Fouché could tell you the
      names of some people who bled freely to get rid of all this trumpery; and,
      in good sooth, it's rather hard, if we could not endure Saint Louis, to be
      obliged to tolerate Saint Napoleon,&mdash;saints, like Bordeaux wine,
      being all the more palatable when they have age to mellow them. I could
      forgive anything, however, but this system of forced marriages; it smacks
      too much of old Frederick for my taste. And one cannot always have the
      luck of your friend General d'Auvergne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt my cheek grow burning hot at the words. Duchesne did not notice my
      confusion, but continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, of all the ill-assorted unions for which his sainted Majesty
      will have to account hereafter, that was unquestionably the most
      extraordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have heard, and I believe too, that the marriage was not of the
      Emperor's making; it was purely a matter of liking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Burke,&rdquo; said he, laughing, &ldquo;you will not tell me that the
      handsomest girl at the Court, with a large dowry, an ancient name, and
      every advantage of position, marries an old weather-beaten soldier&mdash;the
      senior officer of her own father once&mdash;of her own free will and
      choice. The thing is absurd. No, no; these are the Imperial recompenses,
      when grand duchies are scarce and confiscations few. The Emperor does not
      travel for nothing. He brought back with him from Egypt something besides
      his Mameluke Guard: that clever trick the pachas have of providing a
      favorite with an ex-sultana. There, there! don't look so angrily. We shall
      both be marshals of France one of these days, and that may reconcile one
      to a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are determined to owe nothing of your promotion to a blind devotion
      to Napoleon,&mdash;that's certain,&rdquo; said I, annoyed at the tone of
      insolent disparagement in which he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&mdash;perfectly right there,&rdquo; replied he, in a quiet tone
      of voice. &ldquo;No man would rather hug himself up in an illusion, if he could
      but make it minister to his pleasure or his enjoyment; but when it does
      neither,&mdash;when the material is so flimsy as to be seen through at
      every minute,&mdash;I throw it from me as a worthless garment, unfit to
      wear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you, then, deem Napoleon's glory such?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, to me it is. How am I a sharer in his triumphs, save as the
      charger that marches in the cavalcade? You don't perceive that I, as the
      descendant of an old Loyalist family, would have fared far better with the
      Bourbons, from reasons of blood and kindred; and a hundred times better
      with the Jacobins, from very recklessness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How then came it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will spare you the question. I liked neither emigration nor the
      guillotine, and preferred the slow suffering of ennui to the quick death
      of the scaffold. There has been but one career in France for many a day
      past. I adopted it as much from necessity as choice; I followed it more
      from habit than either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you cannot be insensible to the greatness of your country, nor her
      success in arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor am I; but these things are a small ingredient in patriotism. You, the
      stranger, share with us all our triumphs in the field. But the inherent
      features of a nation,&mdash;the distinctive traits of which every son of
      the soil feels proud,&mdash;where are they now? What is France to me more
      than to you? One half my kindred are exiled; of those who remain, many
      regard me as a renegade. Their properties confiscated, themselves
      suspected, what tie binds them to this country? You are not more an alien
      here than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, Duchesne, you shed your blood freely for this same cause you
      condemn. You charged the Pratzen, some days ago, with four squadrons,
      against a whole column of Russian cavalry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and would again to-morrow, boy. Had you been a gambler, I need n't
      have told you that it is the game, not the stake, that interests the real
      gamester. But come, do not fancy I want to make you a convert to these
      tiresome theories of mine. What say you to the pretty Mademoiselle
      Pauline? Did you admire her much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is unquestionably very handsome; but, if I must confess it, her
      manner towards me was too ungracious to make me loud in her praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that, I vow,&rdquo; said Duchesne; &ldquo;that saucy air has an indescribable
      charm for me. I don't know if it is not the very thing which pleases me
      most about her. She has been spoiled by flattery and admiration; for her
      beauty and her fortune are prizes in the great wheel. And that she is
      aware of the fact is nothing wonderful, considering that she hears it
      repeated every evening of her life, by every-rank in the service, from a
      marshal of France down to&mdash;a captain in the <i>chasseurs à cheval</i>,&rdquo;
       said he, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, probably, was one of the last to tell her so,&rdquo; said I, looking at
      him slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have we here?&rdquo; said he, suddenly, without paying any attention to my
      remark, as he again took up the &ldquo;Moniteur.&rdquo; &ldquo;'It is rumored that the
      Russian Prince, Drobretski, was dangerously wounded this morning in an
      affair of honor. The names of the other party and the seconds are still
      unknown; but the efforts of the police, stimulated by the express command
      of the Emperor, will, it is to be hoped, succeed in discovering them ere
      long.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that the name of your Russian friend of last night, Duchesne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And the same person, too, formerly Russian minister at Madrid, and
      latterly residing on his parole at Paris,&rdquo; continued he, reading from the
      paper. &ldquo;'The very decided part his Majesty has taken against the practice
      of duelling is strengthened on this occasion by a recent order of council
      respecting the prisoners on parole.' <i>Diable!</i> Burke, what a
      scrupulous turn Napoleon seems to have taken in regard to these Cossacks!
      And here follows a long list of witnesses who have seen nothing, and
      suspicious circumstances that occur every morning in the week without
      remark. After all, I don't think the Empire has advanced us much on the
      score of police,&mdash;the same threadbare jests, the same old practical
      jokes, amused the <i>bourgeoisie</i> in the time of Louis the Fourteenth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't clearly understand your meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is simply this,&mdash;that every Government of France, from Pepin
      downwards, has understood the value of throwing public interest, from time
      to time, on a false scent, and to this end has maintained a police. Now,
      if for any cause his Majesty thought proper to incarcerate that Russian
      prince in the Temple or La Force, the affair would cause a tremendous
      sensation in Paris, and soon would ring over the whole of Germany and the
      rest of Europe, with every variation of despotism, tyranny, and all that,
      attached to it, long before any advantages to be derived from the step
      could be realized. Whereas see the effect of an opposite policy. By this
      report of a duel, for instance,&mdash;I don't mean to assert it false,
      here,&mdash;the whole object is attained, and an admirable subject of
      Imperial praise obtained into the bargain. Governments have learned wisdom
      from the cuttlefish, and can muddy the water on their enemies at the
      moment of danger. I should not be surprised if the affairs of the Bank
      looked badly this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evident, then, you disbelieve the whole statement about the duel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;who is there in all Paris, from
      Montmartre to St. Denis, believes, or disbelieves, any one thing in the
      times we live in? Have we not trusted so implicitly for years past to the
      light of our reason that we have actually injured our eyesight with ils
      brilliancy. Little reproach, indeed, to our minds, when our very senses
      seem to mislead us; when one sees the people who enter the Tuileries now
      with embroidered coats, who in our father's days never came nearer to it
      than the Place de Carrousel. <i>Hélas!</i> it's no time for incredulity,
      that's certain. But to conclude,&rdquo; said he, turning to the paper once more:
      &ldquo;'The <i>commissaires de police</i> throughout Paris have received orders
      to spare no effort to unravel the mystery and detect the other parties in
      this unhappy affair.' Military tribunal; prisoners on parole; rights of
      hospitality; honor of France; and the old peroration,&mdash;the usual
      compliment on the wisdom which presides over every department of state.
      How weary I do become of all this! Let your barber puff his dye for the
      whiskers, or your bootmaker the incomparable effulgence of his blacking,&mdash;the
      thing is in keeping, no one objects to it. I don't find fault with my old
      friend, Pigault Lebrun, if he now and then plays the critic on himself,
      and shows the world the beauties they neglectfully slurred over. But,
      Burke, have you ever seen a <i>bureau de police?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never; and I have the greatest curiosity to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then, I 'll be your guide. The <i>commissaire</i> of this quarter
      has a very extended jurisdiction, stretching away towards the Bois de
      Boulogne, and if there be anything in this report, he is certain to know
      it; and assuredly, no other topic will be talked of till to-morrow
      evening, for it's not Opera night, and Talma does not play either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I willingly accepted this proposition; and when our breakfast was over, we
      mounted our horses, and set out for the place in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the forms of justice where we are now going,&rdquo; said Duchesne, &ldquo;be
      divested of much of their pomp and ceremony, be assured of one thing,&mdash;it
      is not at the expense of the more material essence. Of all the police
      tribunals about Paris, this obscure den in the Bue de Dix Sous is the most
      effective. Situated in a quarter where crime is as rife as fever in the
      Pontine Marshes, it has become acquainted with the haunts and habits of
      the lowest class in Paris,&mdash;the lowest class, probably, in any city
      of Europe. Watching with parental solicitude, it tracks the criminal from
      his first step in vice to his last deed in crime; from his petty theft to
      his murder. Knowing the necessities to which poverty impels men, and
      studying with attention the impulses that grow up amid despair and hunger,
      it sees motives through a mist of intervening circumstances that would
      baffle less subtle observers, and can trace the tortuous windings of crime
      where no other sight could find the clew. Is it not strange to think with
      what ingenuity men will investigate the minute anatomy of vice, and how
      little they will do to apply this knowledge to its remedy? Like the
      surgeon, enamored of his operating skill, he would rather exhibit his
      dexterity in the amputation, than his science in the saving, of the limb.
      Such is the bureau of the police in the poorer quarters. In the more
      fashionable ones it takes a higher flight; amusing the world with its
      scenes, alternately humorous and pathetic, it forms a kind of feature in
      the literature of the period, and is the only reading of thousands. In
      these places the <i>commissaire</i> is usually a <i>bon vivant</i> and a
      wit; despising the miserable function of administering the law, he takes
      his seat upon the bench to cap jokes with the witnesses, puzzle the
      complainant, and embarrass the prisoner. To the reporters alone is he
      civil; and in return, his poor witticisms appear in the morning papers,
      with the usual 'loud laughter' that never existed save in type.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we thus chatted, we entered a quarter of dirty and narrow streets,
      inhabited by a poor-looking, squalid population. The women, with little to
      mark their sex in their coarse, heavy countenances, wore colored kerchiefs
      on their heads in lieu of a cap, and were for the most part without shoes
      or stockings. The men, a brutalized, stupid race, sat smoking in the
      doorways, scarcely lifting their eyes as we passed; or some were eating a
      coarse morsel of black rye bread, which, by their eagerness in devouring
      it, seemed an unusual delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scarcely believed there was such poverty in Paris,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but
      this is by no means the worst of the quarter. Though M. de Champagny, in
      his late report, makes no mention of these 'signs of prosperity,' we are
      now entering the region where, even in noonday, the passage is deemed
      perilous; but the number of police agents on duty to-day will make the
      journey a safe one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The street we entered at the moment consisted of a mass of tall houses,
      almost falling from decay and neglect,&mdash;scarcely a window remained in
      many of them; while in front, a row of miserable booths, formed of rude
      planks, narrowed the passage to a mere path, scarce wide enough for three
      people abreast. There, vice of every description, and drunkenness, waited
      not for the dark hours to shroud them, but came forth in the sunlight,&mdash;the
      ruffian shouts of intoxication mingling with the almost maniacal laugh of
      misery or the reckless chorus of some degrading song. Half-naked wretches
      leaned from the windows as we passed along,&mdash;some staring in stupid
      wonderment at our appearance; others saluting us with mockery and grimace,
      or even calling out to us in the slang dialect of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Duchesne, as he saw the expression of horror and disgust the
      scene impressed on me, &ldquo;here are the rotting seeds of revolutions
      putrefying, to germinate at some future day. Starvation and vice, misery,
      even to despair, inhabit every den around you. The furious and
      bloodthirsty wretch of '92, the Chouan, the Jacobite, the escaped
      galley-slave, the untaken murderer, are here side by side,&mdash;crime
      their great bond of union. To this place men come for an assassin or a
      false witness, as to a market. Such are the wrecks the retiring waves of a
      Revolution have left us. So long as the trade of blood lasted, openly,
      like vultures, they fattened on it; but once the reign of order restored,
      they were driven to murder and outrage as a livelihood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was speaking, we approached a narrow arched passage, within which
      a flight of stone steps arose. &ldquo;We dismount here,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment a group of ragged creatures, of every age, surrounded
      us to hold our horses, not noticing the orderly who rode at some distance
      behind us. I followed Duchesne up the steps, and along a gloomy corridor,
      to a little courtyard, where several dismounted gendarmes were standing in
      a circle, chatting. Passing through this, we entered a dirty, mean-looking
      house, around the door of which several people were collected, some of
      whom saluted the chevalier as he came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are these fellows?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;They seem to know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nothing but the common police spies,&rdquo; said he, carelessly; &ldquo;the
      fellows who lounge about the cabarets and the low gambling-houses. But
      here comes one of higher mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he laid his hand on the arm of a tall, powerful-looking man,
      in a blouse; he wore immense whiskers, and a great beard, descending far
      below his chin. &ldquo;Ah! Bocquin, what have we got going forward to-day? I
      came to show a young friend here the interior of your <i>salle</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Capitaine, your most obedient,&rdquo; said the man, in a deep
      voice, as he removed his casquette, and bowed ceremoniously to us; &ldquo;and
      yours also, Monsieur,&rdquo; added he, turning to me. &ldquo;Why, there is nothing to
      speak of, save that duel, Capitaine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Bocquin; no nonsense with me. What was that story got up
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you mistake there,&rdquo; said Bocquin. &ldquo;By Jove! there's a man badly
      wounded, shot through the neck, and no one to tell a word about it. No
      seconds present, the thing done quite privately; the wounded man left at
      his own door, and the other off,&mdash;Heaven knows where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you believe this tale, Bocquin?&rdquo; said Duchesne, superciliously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe it!&mdash;that I do. I have been to see the place where the man
      lay; and by tracking the wheel marks, I have discovered they came from the
      Champs Élysées. The cabriolet, too, was a private one; no <i>fiacre</i>
      has got so narrow a tire to the wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Closely followed up,&mdash;eh, Burke?&rdquo; said the chevalier, turning
      towards me with a smile of admiration at his sagacity. &ldquo;Go on, Bocquin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I followed the scent to the Barrière de l'Étoile, where I learned
      that one cabriolet passed towards the Bois de Boulogne, and returned in
      about half an hour. As the pace was a sharp one, I guessed they could not
      have gone far, and so I turned into the wood at the first road to the
      right, where there is least recourse of people; and, by Jove! I was all
      correct. There, in a small open space between the trees, I saw the marks
      of recent footsteps, and a little farther on found the grass all covered
      with blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Bocquin! Monsieur Bocquin! the <i>commissaire</i> wants you,&rdquo;
       cried a voice from the landing of the stair; and with an apology for
      leaving thus suddenly, he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      We followed, however, curious to hear the remainder of this singular
      history; and, after some difficulty, succeeded in gaining admittance to a
      small room, now densely crowded with people, the most of whom were of the
      very lowest class. The <i>commissaire</i> speedily made place for us
      beside him on the bench; for, like every one else in a conspicuous
      position, he also was an acquaintance of Duchesne.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the <i>commissaire</i> conversed with Bocquin in a low tone, we had
      time to observe the <i>salle</i> and its occupants. Except the witnesses,
      two or three of whom were respectable persons, they were the
      squalid-looking, ragged wretches of the quarter, listening with the greedy
      appetite of crime to any tale of bloodshed. The surgeon, who had just
      returned from visiting the wounded man, was waiting to be examined. To him
      now the <i>commissaire</i> directed his attention. It appeared that the
      wound was by no means of the dangerous character described, being merely
      through the fleshy portion of the neck, without injuring any part of
      importance. Having described circumstantially the extent of the injury and
      its probable cause, he replied to a question of the <i>commissaire</i>,
      that no entreaty could persuade the wounded man to give any explanation of
      the occurrence, nor mention the name of his adversary. Duchesne paid
      little apparent attention to the evidence, and before it was concluded,
      asked me if I were satisfied with my police experience, and disposed to
      move away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment there was a stir among the people round the door, and
      we heard the officers of the court cry out, &ldquo;Room! make way there!&rdquo; and
      the same moment General Duroc entered, accompanied by an aide-de-camp. He
      had been sent specially by the Emperor to ascertain what progress the
      investigation had made. His Majesty had determined to push the inquiry to
      its utmost limits. The general appeared dissatisfied with the little
      prospect there appeared of elucidation; and turning to Duchesne, remarked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is peculiarly ill-timed just now, as negotiations are pending with
      Russia, and the prince's family are about the person of the Czar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as the wound would seem of little consequence, in a few days perhaps
      the whole thing may blow over,&rdquo; said Duchesne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for that very reason,&rdquo; replied Duroc, earnestly, &ldquo;that we are
      pressed for time. The object is to mark the sentiments of his Majesty <i>now</i>.
      Should the prince be once pronounced out of danger, it will be too late
      for sympathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I perceive,&rdquo; said Duchesne, smiling; &ldquo;your observation is most just.
      If my friend here, however, cannot put you on the track, I fear you have
      little to hope for elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware of that; and Monsieur Cauchois knows the great reliance his
      Majesty reposes in his skill and activity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Cauchois, the <i>commissaire</i>, bowed with a most respectful
      air at the compliment, probably of all others the highest that could be
      paid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brilliant soirée we had last evening, Duchesne,&rdquo; said the general. &ldquo;I
      hope this unhappy affair will not close that house at present; you are
      aware the prince is the suitor of mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only suspected as much,&rdquo; said the chevalier, with a peculiar smile; &ldquo;it
      was my first evening there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As General Duroc addressed a few words in a low tone to the <i>commissaire</i>,
      the man called Bocquin approached the bench, and handed up a small slip of
      paper to Duchesne. The chevalier opened it, and having thrown his eyes
      over it, passed it into my hand. All I could see were two words, written
      coarsely with the pencil,&mdash;&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier turned the back of the paper, and wrote, &ldquo;Fifty napoleons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On reading which the large man tore the scrap, and nodding slightly with
      his head, sauntered from the room. We rose a few moments after, and having
      taken a formal leave of the general and the <i>commissaire</i>, proceeded
      towards the street, where we had left our horses. As we passed along the
      corridor, however, we found Bocquin awaiting us. He opened a door into a
      small, mean-looking apartment, of which he appeared the owner. Having
      ushered us in, and cautiously closed it behind him, he drew from his
      pocket a piece of cloth, to which a button and a piece of gold embroidery
      were attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your jacket would be spoiled without this morsel, Captain,&rdquo; said he,
      laughing, in a low, dry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it would, Bocquin,&rdquo; said Duchesne, examining his coat, which I now
      perceived was torn on the shoulder, and a small piece&mdash;the exact one
      in his hand&mdash;wanting, but which had escaped my attention from the
      mass of gold lace and embroidery with which it was covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Bocquin,&rdquo; said Duchesne, in a tone much graver than he had
      used before, &ldquo;I never noticed that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i> I believe you,&rdquo; said he, laughing; &ldquo;nor did I, till you
      sat on the bench, when I was so pleased with your coolness, I could not
      for the life of me interrupt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got any money, Burke?&rdquo; said the chevalier; &ldquo;some twenty gold
      pieces&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Captain,&rdquo; said Bocquin, &ldquo;not now; another time. I must call upon
      you one of these mornings about another affair, and it will be time enough
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, Bocquin,&rdquo; said the chevalier, putting up his purse again;
      &ldquo;and so, till we meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till we meet, gentlemen,&rdquo; replied the other, as he bowed us respectfully
      to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have but a very faint comprehension of all this, Burke,&rdquo; said
      Duchesne, as he took my arm; &ldquo;you look confoundedly puzzled, I must say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I didn't, I should be an admirable actor, that's all,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I think the thing is plain enough, in all conscience; Bocquin found
      that piece of my jacket on the ground, and, of course, the affair was in
      his hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you mean to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shot Monsieur le Prince this morning, at a quarter past seven
      o'clock, and felt devilish uncomfortable about it till the last ten
      minutes, my boy. If I did not confide the matter to you before, it was
      because that until all chance of detection was passed, I could not expose
      you to the risk of an examination before the <i>préfet de police</i>.
      Happily, now these dangers are all over. Bocquin is too clever a fellow
      not to throw all the other spies on a wrong scent, so that we need have no
      fear of the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could scarcely credit the evidence of my senses at the coolness and
      duplicity of the chevalier throughout an affair of such imminent risk, nor
      was I less astonished at the account he gave of the whole proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word, on leaving the soirée, had decided there should be a meeting the
      following day; and as the Russian well knew the danger of his adventure,
      from the law which was recently passed regarding prisoners on parole, he
      proposed they should meet without seconds on either side. Duchesne
      acceded; and it was arranged that the chevalier should drive along the Bue
      de Rivoli at seven the next morning, where the Russian would join him, and
      they should drive together to the Bois de Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do my Cossack justice,&rdquo; said Duchesne, &ldquo;he behaved admirably
      throughout the whole affair; and on taking his place beside me in the cab,
      entered into conversation freely and easily on the topics of the day. We
      chatted of the campaign; of the cavalry; of the Russian service,&mdash;their
      size and equipment, only needing a higher organization to make them
      first-rate troops. We spoke of the Emperor Alexander, of whom he was
      evidently proud, and much pleased to hear the favorable opinion Napoleon
      entertained of his ability and capacity; and it was in the middle of an
      anecdote about Savary and the Czar we arrived at the Bois de Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not tell you the details of the affair, save that we loaded our
      own pistols, and stepped the ground ourselves. They were like other things
      of the same sort,&mdash;the first shot concluded the matter. I aimed at
      his shoulder, but the pistol threw high. As to his bullet, it was only
      awhile ago I knew it went so near me. It was nervous work passing the <i>barrière</i>;
      for had he not made an effort to sit up straight in the cab, the sentry
      might have detained and examined us. All that you heard about his being
      left at his own door, covered with blood and fainting, I need not tell you
      has no truth. I never left the spot till the door was opened, and I saw
      him in the hands of a servant. Of course I concealed my face, and then
      drove off at full speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time we arrived at the Luxembourg, and Duchesne, with all the
      coolness in the world, joined a knot of persons engaged in discussing the
      duel, and endeavoring, by sundry clever and ingenious explanations, to
      account for the circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sauntered along to my quarters, I pondered over the adventure and the
      character of the chevalier; and however I might turn the matter in my
      mind, one thought was ever uppermost,&mdash;a sincere wish that I had not
      been made his confidant in the secret.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE RETURN OF THE WOUNDED
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few mornings after this occurrence, when, as Duchesne himself
      prophesied, all memory of it was completely forgotten, the <i>ordre du
      jour</i> from the Tuileries commanded all the troops then garrisoned in
      Paris to be under arms at an early hour in the Champs Élysées, when the
      Emperor would pass them in review. The spectacle had, however, another
      object, which was not generally known. The convoys of the wounded from
      Austerlitz were that same day to arrive at Paris, and the display of
      troops was intended at once to honor this <i>entrée</i>, and give to the
      sad procession of the maimed and dying the semblance of a triumph. Such
      were the artful devices which ever ministered to the deceit of the nation,
      and suffered them to look on but one side of their glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I anticipated, the chevalier was greatly out of temper at the whole of
      this proceeding. He detested nothing more than those military displays
      which are got up for the populace; he despised the exhibition of troops to
      the vulgar and unmeaning criticism of tailors and barbers; and, more than
      all, he shrank from the companionship of the National Guard of Paris,&mdash;those
      shop-keeping soldiers, with their umbrellas and spectacles, who figured
      with such pride on these occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another affair like this,&rdquo; said he, passionately, &ldquo;and I'd resign my
      commission. A procession at the Porte St. Martin,&mdash;the <i>boeuf gras</i>
      on Easter Monday,&mdash;I'm your man for either: but to sit bolt upright
      on your saddle for three, maybe four hours; to be stared at by every <i>bourgeois</i>
      from the Rue du Bac; to be pointed at with pink parasols and compared with
      some ribbon-vender of the Boulevards,&mdash;<i>par Saint Louis!</i> I
      can't even bear to think of it! Look yonder,&rdquo; said he, pointing to the
      court of the Palace, where already a regiment was drawn up under arms, and
      passing in inspection before the colonel; &ldquo;there begins the
      dress-rehearsal already. His Majesty says mid-day; the generals of
      division draw out their men at eleven o'clock; the colonels take a look at
      their corps at ten; the <i>chefs de bataillon</i> at nine; and, <i>parbleu!</i>the
      corporals are at work by daybreak. Then, what confounded drilling and
      dressing up, as if Napoleon could detect the slightest waving of the line
      over two leagues of ground; while you see the luckless adjutants flying
      hither and thither, cursing, imprecating, and threatening, and hastily
      reiterating at the head of each company, 'Remember, men, be sure to
      remember, that when the drums beat to arms, you shout &ldquo;Vive l'Empereur!&rdquo;'
      Rely upon it, Burke, if we had but one half of these preparations before a
      battle, we 'd not be the dangerous fellows those Russians and Austrians
      think us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you shall not persuade me that the soldiers feel no
      pride on these occasions. The same men who fight so valiantly for their
      Emperor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop there, I beg of you,&rdquo; said he, bursting into a fit of laughter. &ldquo;I
      must really cry halt now. So long as you live, my dear friend, let nothing
      induce you to repeat that worn cant, 'Fight for their Emperor!' Why, they
      fought as bravely for Turenne, and Villars, and Maréchal Saxe; they were
      as full of courage under Moreau, and Kleber, and Desaix, and Hoche; ay,
      and will be again when the Emperor is no more, and Heaven knows who stands
      in his place. The genius of a French army is fighting, not for gain, nor
      plunder, nor even for glory, so much as for fighting itself; and he is the
      best man who gives them most of it. What reduced the reckless hordes of
      the Revolution to habits of discipline and obedience but the warlike
      spirit of their leaders, whose bravery they respected? And think you
      Napoleon himself does not feel this in his heart, and know the necessity
      of continual war to feed the insatiable appetite of his followers? In a
      word, my friend,&rdquo; added he, in a tone of mock solemnity, &ldquo;we are a great
      people; and Nature intended us to be so by giving us a language in which
      <i>Gloire</i> rhymes with <i>Victoire</i>. And now for the march, for I
      fancy we are late enough already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are few sources of annoyance more poignant than to discover any
      illusion we have long indulged in assailed by the sneers and sarcasms of
      another, who assumes a tone of superior wisdom on the faith of a
      difference of opinion. The mass of our likings and dislikings find their
      way into our heart more from impulse than reason, and when attacked are
      scarcely defensible by any effort of the understanding. This very fact
      renders us more painfully alive to their preservation, and we shrink
      instinctively from any discussion of them. While such is the case, we feel
      more bitterly the cruelty of him who, out of mere wantonness, can sport
      with the sources of our happiness, and assail the hidden stores of so many
      of our pleasures; for unhappily the mockery once listened to lies
      associated with the idea forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already had Duchesne stripped me of more than one delusion, and made me
      feel that I was but indulging in a deceptive happiness in my dream of
      life; and often did I regret that I ever knew him. It is not enough to
      feel the sophistry of one's adversary, you should be able to detect and
      expose it, otherwise the triumphant tone he assumes gives him an air of
      victory which ends by imposing on yourself. And of this I now felt
      convinced in my own case.
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts rendered me silent as we wended our way towards the
      Tuileries, where the various officers of the staff and the <i>corps
      d'élite</i> were assembled. Here we found several of the marshals in
      waiting for the Emperor, while the Mameluke Guard, in all the splendor of
      its gay equipments, stood around the great entrance to the Palace. Many
      handsome equipages were also there; one, conspicuous above the rest for
      its livery of white and gold, with four outriders, belonged to Madame
      Murat, the Grand-Duchess of Berg, whose taste for splendor and show
      extended to every department of her household.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last there was a movement in those nearest the Palace; the drums beat
      to arms, the guard within the vestibule presented, and the Emperor
      appeared, followed by a brilliant staff. He stood for a few seconds on the
      steps, his hands clasped behind his back, and his head a little bent
      forwards as if in thought; then, drawing himself up, he looked with a gaze
      of proud composure on the crowd that filled the court of the Palace, and
      where now all was silent and still. Never before had I remarked the same
      imperious expression of his features; but as his eye ranged over the
      brilliant array, now I could read the innate consciousness of superiority
      in which he excelled. Ney, Murat, Victor, Bessières,&mdash;how little
      seemed they all before that mighty genius, whose glory they but reflected!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how lightly then did I deem the mocking jests of Duchesne, or all that
      his sarcasm could invent! There stood the conqueror of Italy and Egypt,
      the victor of Marengo and Austerlitz, looking every inch a monarch and a
      soldier. Whether from thoughtless inattention or studied affectation I
      cannot say, but at that moment, when all stood in respectful silence
      before the Emperor, Duchesne had approached the grille of the Palace, next
      to the Place du Carrousel, and was busily chatting with a pretty-looking
      girl, who, with a number of others, sat in a hired calèche. A hearty burst
      of laughter at something he said rang through the court, and turned every
      eye in that direction. In an instant the Emperor's eagle glance pierced
      the distance, and fastened on the chevalier, who, seated carelessly on one
      side of his saddle, paid no attention to what was going forward; when
      suddenly an aide-de-camp touched him on the arm, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Capitaine Duchesne, his Majesty the Emperor would speak with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duchesne turned; a faint, a very faint flush, covered his cheek, and
      putting spurs to his horse, he galloped up to the front of the terrace,
      where the Emperor was standing. From the distance at which I stood, to
      hear what passed was impossible; but I watched with a most painful
      interest the scene before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor's attitude was unchanged as the chevalier rode up; and when
      Duchesne himself seemed to listen with a respectful manner to the words of
      his Majesty, I could see by his easy bearing that his self-possession had
      never deserted him. The interview lasted not many minutes, when the
      Emperor waved his hand haughtily; and the chevalier, saluting with his
      sabre, backed his horse some paces, and then, wheeling round, rapidly
      galloped towards the gate, through which he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening, then, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, with a smile, &ldquo;I hope to have
      the honor.&rdquo; And, with a courteous bow, rode on towards the archway opening
      on the quay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; said I, eagerly, to the officer at my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head as if doubtful, and half fearing even to whisper at the
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His privilege of the <i>élite</i> is withdrawn, sir,&rdquo; said an old general
      officer. &ldquo;He must leave Paris to join his regiment in twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; muttered I, half aloud, when a savage frown from the
      veteran officer corrected my words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir!&rdquo; said he, in a low voice, where every word was thickened to a
      guttural sound&mdash;&ldquo;what, sir! is the court of the Tuileries no more
      than a canteen or a bivouac? <i>Pardieu!</i> if it was not for his laced
      jacket he had been degraded to the ranks; ay, and deserved it too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coarse accents and underbred tone of the speaker showed me at once
      that it was one of the old generals of the Republican army, who never
      could endure the descendants of aristocratic families in the service, and
      who were too willing always to attribute to insolence and premeditated
      affront even the slightest breaches of military etiquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Emperor mounted, and accompanied by the officers of his
      staff, rode forward towards the Champs Élysées, while all of lesser note
      followed at a distance. From the garden of the Tuileries to the Barrière
      de l'Étoile the troops were ranged in four lines, the cavalry of the Guard
      and the artillery forming the ranks along the road by which the convoy
      must pass. It was a bright day, with a clear, frosty atmosphere and a blue
      sky, and well suited the brilliant spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the Emperor issued from the Tuileries, when ten thousand
      shouts of &ldquo;Vive l'Empereur!&rdquo; rent the air; the cannon of the Invalides
      thundered forth at the same moment; and the crash of the military bands
      added their clangor to the sounds of joy. He rode slowly along the line,
      stopping frequently to speak with some of the soldiers, and giving orders
      to his suite concerning them. Of the officers in his staff that day, the
      greater number had been wounded at Austerlitz, and still bore the traces
      of their injuries. Rapp displayed a tremendous scar from a sabre across
      his cheek; Sebastiani wore his sword-arm in a sling; and Friant, unable to
      mount his horse, followed the Emperor on foot, leaning on a stick, and
      walking with great difficulty. The sight of these brave men, whose
      devotion to Napoleon had been proved on so many battlefields, added to the
      interest of the scene, and tended to excite popular enthusiasm to its
      utmost. But on Napoleon still all eyes were bent. The general who led
      their armies to victory, the monarch who raised France to the proudest
      place among the nations, was there, within a few paces of them. Each word
      he spoke was sinking deeply into some heart, prouder of that moment than
      of rank or riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      So slow was the Emperor's progress along the ranks that it was near three
      o'clock before he had arrived at the extremity of the line. The cavalry
      were now ordered to form in squadrons, and move past in close order. While
      this movement was effecting, a cannon-shot at the <i>barrière</i>
      announced the approach of the convoy. The cavalry were halted in line once
      more, and the same moment the first wagon of the train appeared above the
      summit of the hill. So secretly had the whole been managed that none, save
      the officers of the various staffs, knew what was coming. While each look
      was turned, then, towards the <i>barrière</i> in astonishment, gradually
      the wagon rolled on, another followed, and another: these were, however,
      but the ambulances of the hospitals. And now the wounded themselves came
      in sight,&mdash;a white flag, that well-known signal, waving in front of
      each wagon, while a guard of honor, consisting of picked men of the
      different regiments, rode at either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      One loud cheer&mdash;a shout echoed back from the Tuileries itself&mdash;rang
      out, as the soldiers saw their brave companions restored to them once
      more. With that impulse which, even in discipline, French soldiers never
      forget, the men rushed forward to the wagons, and in a moment officers and
      men were in the arms of their comrades. What a scene it was to see the
      poor and wasted forms, mangled by shot and maimed of limb, brightening up
      again as home and friends surrounded them,&mdash;to hear their faint
      voices mingle with the questions for this one or for that, while the fate
      of some brave fellow met but one word in elegy!
    </p>
    <p>
      On they passed,&mdash;a sad train, but full of glorious memories. There
      were the grenadiers of Oudinot, who carried the Russian centre; eleven
      wagons were filled with their wounded. Here come the voltigeurs of
      Bernadotte's brigade; see how the fellows preserve their ancient repute,
      cheering and laughing,&mdash;ever the same, whether roistering at midnight
      in the Faubourg St. Antoine or rushing madly upon the ranks of the enemy!
      There are the dragoons of Nansouty, who charged the Imperial Guard of
      Russia; see the proud line that floats on their banner, &ldquo;All wounded by
      the sabre!&rdquo; And here come the cuirassiers of the Guard, with a detachment
      of their own as escort; how splendidly they look in the bright sun, and
      how proudly they come!
    </p>
    <p>
      As I looked, the Emperor rode forward, bareheaded, his whole staff
      uncovered. &ldquo;Chapeau bas, Messieurs!&rdquo; said he, in a loud voice. &ldquo;Honor to
      the brave in misfortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the escort halted, and I heard a laugh in front, close to where
      the Emperor was standing; but from the crowded staff around him, could not
      see what was going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said I, curious to learn the least incident of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advance a pace or two, Captain,&rdquo; said the young officer I addressed; &ldquo;you
      can see it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did so, and then beheld&mdash;oh, with what delight and surprise!&mdash;my
      poor friend, Pioche, seated on the driving-seat of a gun, with his hand in
      salute as the Emperor spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou wilt not have promotion, nor a pension. What, then, can I do for
      thee?&rdquo; said Napoleon, smiling. &ldquo;Hast any friend in the service whom I
      could advance for thy sake?»
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>parbleu!</i>&rdquo; said Pioche, scratching his forehead, with a sort
      of puzzle and confusion even the Emperor smiled at, &ldquo;I have a friend. But
      mayhap those wouldn't like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me for nothing thou thinkest I could not, ought not to grant,&rdquo; said
      the Emperor, sternly. &ldquo;What is't now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor corporal seemed thoroughly nonplussed, and for a second or two
      could not reply. At last, as if summoning all his courage for the effort,
      he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thou canst but refuse, and then the fault will be all thine. She is
      a brave girl, and had she been a man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom can he mean?&rdquo; said Napoleon. &ldquo;Is the man's head wandering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>mon général!</i> all right there; that shell has turned many a
      sabre's edge. I was talking of Minette, the vivandière of ours. If thou
      art so bent on doing me a service, why, promote <i>her</i>, and thou'lt
      make the whole regiment proud of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech was lost in the laugh which, beginning with the Emperor,
      extended to the staff, and at last to all the bystanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost wish I should make her one of my aides-de-camp?&rdquo; said Napoleon,
      still laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i> thou hast more ill-favored ones among them,&rdquo; said Pioche,
      with a significant look at the grim faces of Rapp and Dam, whose hard and
      weather-beaten features never deigned a smile, while every other face was
      moved in laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But thou hast not said yet what I am to do,&rdquo; rejoined the Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou used not to be so hard to understand,&rdquo; grumbled out Pioche. &ldquo;I have
      seen the time thou 'd have said, 'Is it Minette that was wounded at the
      Adige? Is that the girl stood in the square at Marengo? <i>Parbleu!</i> I
      'll give her the cross of the Legion!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she shall have it, Corporal Pioche,&rdquo; said Napoleon, as he detached
      the decoration he wore on the breast of his coat. &ldquo;Give the order for the
      vivandière to advance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarce were the words spoken, when the sound of a horse pressed to his
      speed was heard, and mounted upon a small but showy Arab, a present from
      the regiment, Minette rode up, in the bloom of health, and flushed by
      exercise and the excitement of the moment. I never saw her look so
      handsome. Reining in her horse short, as she came in front of the Emperor,
      the animal reared up, almost straight, and pawed the air with his
      forelegs; while she, with all the composure in life, raised her hand to
      her cap, and saluted the Emperor with an action the most easy and
      graceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast some yonder,&rdquo; said Pioche, with a grim smile at the staff,
      &ldquo;would be sore puzzled to keep their saddles as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minette,&rdquo; said the Emperor, while he gazed on her handsome features with
      evident pleasure, &ldquo;your name is well known to me for many actions of
      kindness and self-devotion. Wear this cross of the Legion of Honor; you
      will not value it the less that until now it has been only worn by me.
      Whenever you find one worthy to be your husband, Minette, I will charge
      myself with the dowry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sire!&rdquo; said the trembling girl, as she pressed the Emperor's fingers
      to her lips,&mdash;&ldquo;oh, Sire, is this real?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>parbleu!</i>&rdquo; said Pioche, wiping a large tear from his eye as he
      spoke; &ldquo;he can make thee be a man, and make me feel like a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Duroc attached the cross to the buttonhole of the vivandière's frock,
      she sat pale as death, totally overcome by her sensations of pride, and
      unable to say more than &ldquo;Oh, Sire!&rdquo; which she repeated three or four times
      at intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the procession moved on; other wagons followed with their brave
      fellows; but all the interest of the scene was now, for me at least,
      wrapped up in that one incident, and I took but little notice of the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For full two hours the cortege continued to roll on,&mdash;wagon after
      wagon, filled with the shattered remnants of an army. Yet such was the
      indomitable spirit of the people, such the heartfelt passion for glory,
      all deemed that procession the proudest triumph of their arms. Nor was
      this feeling confined to the spectators; the wounded themselves leaned
      eagerly over the sides of the <i>charrettes</i> to gaze into the crowds on
      either side, seeking some old familiar face, and looking through all their
      sufferings proudly on the dense mob beneath them. Some tried to cheer, and
      waved their powerless hands; but others, faint and heart-sick, turned
      their glazed eyes towards the &ldquo;Invalides,&rdquo; whose lofty dome appeared above
      the trees, as though to say, that was now their resting-place,&mdash;the
      only one before the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      He who witnessed that day could have little doubt about the guiding spirit
      of the French nation; nor could he distrust their willingness to sacrifice
      anything&mdash;nay, all&mdash;to national glory. Suffering and misery,
      wounds, ghastly and dreadful, were on every side; and yet not one word of
      pity, not a look of compassion was there. These men were, in <i>their</i>
      eyes, far too highly placed for sympathy; theirs was that path to which
      all aspired, and their trophies were their own worn frames and mangled
      bodies. And then how they brightened up as the Emperor would draw near!
      how even the faintest would strive to catch his eye and gaze with parted
      lips on him as he spoke, as though drinking in his very words,&mdash;the
      balm to their bruised hearts,&mdash;and the faint cry of &ldquo;l'Empereur!
      l'Empereur!&rdquo; passed like a murmur along the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until the last wagon had defiled before him did the Emperor leave the
      ground. It was then nearly dark, and already the lamps were lighted along
      the quays, and the windows of the Palace displayed the brilliant lustre of
      the preparations for a grand dinner to the marshals.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we moved slowly along in close order, I found myself among a group of
      officers of the Emperor's staffs eagerly discussing the day and its
      events.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for Duchesne,&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;with all his impertinences&mdash;and
      he had enough of them&mdash;he was a brave fellow, and a glorious leader
      at a moment of difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, the Emperor has perhaps forgiven him by this time; and it is
      not likely he would mar the happiness of a day like this by disgracing an
      officer of the <i>élite</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong, my friend; his Majesty is not sorry for the occasion which
      can prove that he knows as well how to punish as to reward. Duchesne's
      fate is sealed. You are not old enough to remember, as I can, the morning
      at Lonado, where the same <i>ardre du jour</i> conferred a mark of honor
      on one brother, and condemned another to be shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was this, indeed, the case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, was it. Many can tell you of it, as well as myself. They were both in
      the same regiment&mdash;the fifteenth demi-brigade of light infantry. They
      held a château at Salo against the enemy for eight hours, when at length
      the elder, who commanded at the front, capitulated and laid down his arms;
      the younger refused to comply, and continued to fight. They were
      reinforced an hour afterwards, and the Austrians beaten off. The day after
      they were both tried, and the result was as I have told you; the utmost
      favor the younger could obtain was, not to witness the execution of his
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I heard this story, my very blood curdled in my veins, and I looked
      with a kind of dread on him who now rode a few paces in front of me,&mdash;the
      stern and pitiless Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last we entered the court of the Tuileries, when the Emperor,
      dismissing his staff, entered the Palace, and we separated, to follow our
      own plans for the evening. For a moment or two I remained uncertain which
      way to turn. I wished much to see Duchesne, yet scarcely hoped to meet
      with him by returning to the Luxembourg. It was not the time to be away
      from him, at a moment like this, and I resolved to seek him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      For above an hour I went from café to café, where he was in the habit of
      resorting, but to no purpose. He had not been seen in any of them during
      the day; so that at length I turned homeward with the faint hope that I
      should see him there on my arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow I never had felt more sad and depressed; and the events of the
      day, so far from making me participate in the general joy, had left me
      gloomy and desponding. My spirit was little in harmony with the gay and
      merry groups that passed along the streets, chanting their campaigning
      songs, and usually having some old soldier of the &ldquo;Guard&rdquo; amongst them;
      for they felt it as a fête, and were hurrying to the cabarets to celebrate
      the day of Austerlitz.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. THE CHEVALIER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When men of high courage and proud hearts meet with reverses in life, our
      anxiety is rather to learn what new channel their thoughts and exertions
      will take in future, than to hear how they have borne up under misfortune.
      I knew Duchesne too well to suppose that any turn of fate would find him
      wholly unprepared; but still, a public reprimand, and from the lips of the
      Emperor, too, was of a nature to wound him to the quick, and I could not
      guess, nor picture to myself in what way he would bear it. The loss of
      grade itself was a thing of consequence, as the service of the <i>élite</i>
      was reckoned a certain promotion; not to speak of&mdash;what to him was
      far more important&mdash;the banishment from Paris and its <i>salons</i>
      to some gloomy and distant encampment. In speculations like these I
      returned to my quarters, where I was surprised to discover that the
      chevalier had not been since morning. I learned from his servant that he
      had dismissed him, with his horses, soon after leaving the Tuileries, and
      had not returned home from that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dined alone that day, and sat moodily by myself, thinking over the
      events of the morning, and wondering what had become of my friend, and
      watching every sound that might tell of his coming. It is true there were
      many things I liked not in Duchesne: his cold, sardonic spirit, his <i>moqueur</i>
      temperament, chilled and repelled me; but I recognized, even through his
      own efforts at concealment, a manly tone of independence, a vigorous
      reliance on self, that raised him in my esteem, and made me regard him
      with a certain species of admiration. With his unsettled or unstable
      political opinions, I greatly dreaded the excess to which a spirit of
      revenge might carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that the Jacobin party, and the Bourbons themselves, lay in wait
      for every erring member of the Imperial side; and I felt no little anxiety
      at the temptations they might hold out to him, at a moment when his
      excitement might have the mastery over his cooler judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the evening a Government messenger arrived with a large letter
      addressed to him from the Minister of War; and even this caused me fresh
      uneasiness, since I connected the despatch in my mind with some detail of
      duty which his absence might leave unperformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long past midnight, as I sat, vainly endeavoring to occupy myself
      with a book, which each moment I laid down to listen, when suddenly I
      heard the roll of a <i>fiacre</i> in the court beneath, the great doors
      banged and closed, and the next moment the chevalier entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dressed in plain clothes, and looked somewhat paler than usual, but
      though evidently laboring under excitement, affected his wonted ease and
      carelessness of manner, as, taking a chair in front of me, he sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a day of worry and trouble this has been, my dear friend!&rdquo; he began.
      &ldquo;From the moment I last saw you to the present one, I have not rested, and
      with four invitations to dinner, I have not dined anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused as he said thus much, as if expecting me to say something; and I
      perceived that the embarrassment he felt rather increased than otherwise.
      I therefore endeavored to mumble out something about his hurried departure
      and the annoyance of such a sentence, when he stopped me suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as to <i>that</i>, I fancy the matter is arranged already; I should
      have had a letter from the War Office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is one here; it came three hours ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned at once to the table, and breaking the seal, perused the packet
      in silence, then handed it to me, as he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bead that; it will save a world of explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was dated five o'clock, and merely contained the following few words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      His Majesty I. and R. accepts the resignation of Senior
      Captain Duchesne, late of the Imperial Guard; who, from the
      date of the present, is no longer in the service of France.

      (Signed)

      BERTHIER, Marshal of France.
</pre>
    <p>
      A small sealed note dropped from the packet, which Duchesne took up, and
      broke open with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! <i>parbleu!</i>&rdquo; cried he, with energy; &ldquo;I thought not. See here,
      Burke; it is Duroc who writes:&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      My dear Duchesne,&mdash;I knew there was no use in making such a
      proposition, and told you as much. The moment I said the
      word 'England,' he shouted out 'No!' in such a tone you
      might have heard it at the Luxembourg. You will perceive,
      then, the thing is impracticable; and perhaps, after all,
      for your own sake, it is better it should be so.

      Yours ever,                                    D.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all mystery to me, Duchesne; I cannot fathom it in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me assist you; a few words will do it. I gave in my <i>démission</i>
      as Captain of the Guard, which, as you see, his Majesty has accepted; we
      shall leave it to the 'Moniteur' of to-morrow to announce whether
      graciously or not. I also addressed a formal letter to Duroc, to ask the
      Emperor's permission to visit England, on private business of my own.&rdquo; His
      eyes sparkled with a malignant lustre as he said these last words, and his
      cheek grew deep scarlet. &ldquo;This, however, his Majesty has not granted,
      doubtless from private reasons of his own; and thus we stand. Which of us,
      think you, has most spoiled the other's rest for this night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still I do not comprehend. What can take you to England? You have no
      friends there; you've never been in that country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the very word is proscribed,&mdash;that the island is covered
      from his eyes in the map he looks upon, that <i>perfide</i> Albion is the
      demon that haunts his dark hours, and menaces with threatening gesture the
      downfall of all his present glory? Ah, by Saint Denis, boy! had I been
      you, it is not such an epaulette as this I had worn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, Duchesne; I will not hear more. Not to you, nor any one, am I
      answerable for the reasons that have guided my conduct; nor had I listened
      to so much, save that such excitement as yours may make that pardonable
      which in calmer moments is not so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say right, Burke,&rdquo; said he, quickly, and with more seriousness of
      manner; &ldquo;it is seldom I have been betrayed into such a passionate warmth
      as this. I hope I have not offended you. This change of circumstance will
      make none in our friendship. I knew it, my dear boy. And now let us turn
      from such tiresome topics. Where, think you, have I been spending the
      evening? But how could you ever guess? Well, at the Odéon, attending
      Mademoiselle Pierrot, and a very pretty friend of hers,&mdash;one of our
      vivandières, who happens to be in the brigade with mademoiselle's brother,
      and dined there to-day. She only arrived in Paris this morning; and, by
      Jove! there are some handsome faces in our gay <i>salons</i> would
      scarcely stand the rivalry with hers. I must show you the fair Minette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minette!&rdquo; stammered I, while a sickly sensation&mdash;a fear of some
      unknown misfortune to the poor girl&mdash;almost stopped my utterance. &ldquo;I
      know her; she belongs to the Fourth Cuirassiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you know her? Who would have suspected my quiet friend of such an
      acquaintance? And so, you never hinted this to me. <i>Ma foi!</i> I 'd
      have thought twice about throwing up my commission if I had seen her half
      an hour earlier. Come, tell me all you know of her. Where does she come
      from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of her history I am totally ignorant; I can only tell you that her
      character is without a stain or reproach, in circumstances where few, if
      any save herself, ever walked scathless; that on more than one occasion
      she has displayed heroism worthy of the best among us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear, how disappointed I am! Indeed, I half feared as much:
      she is a regular vivandière of the mélodrame,&mdash;virtuous, high-minded,
      and intrepid. You, of course, believe all this,&mdash;don't be angry,
      Burke,&mdash;but I don't; and the reason is I can't,&mdash;the gods have
      left me incredulous from the cradle. I have a rooted obstinacy about me,
      perfectly irreclaimable. Thus, I fancy Napoleon to be a Corsican; a modern
      marshal to be a promoted sergeant; a judge of the upper court to be a
      public prosecutor; and a vivandière of the <i>grande armée</i>&mdash;But
      I'll not offend,&mdash;don't be afraid, my poor fellow,&mdash;even at the
      risk of the rivalry. Upon my life, I 'm glad to see you have a heart
      susceptible of any little tenderness. But you cannot blame me if I 'm
      weary of this eternal travesty of character which goes on amongst us. Why
      will our Republican and <i>sans culotte</i> friends try courtly airs and
      graces, while our real aristocracy stoop to the affected coarseness of the
      <i>canaille?</i> Is it possible that they who wish to found a new order of
      things do not see that all these pantomime costumes and characters denote
      nothing but change,&mdash;that we are only performing a comedy after all?
      I scarcely expect it will be a five-act one. And, apropos of comedies,&mdash;when
      shall we pay our respects to Madame de Lacostellerie? It will require all
      my diplomacy to keep my ground there under my recent misfortune. Nothing
      short of a tender inquiry from the Duchesse de Montserrat will open the
      doors for me. Alas, and alas! I suppose I shall have to fall back on the
      Faubourg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is the step irrevocable, Duchesne? Can you really bring yourself to
      forego a career which opened with such promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And terminated with such disgrace,&rdquo; added he, smiling placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay; don't affect to take it thus. Your services would have placed
      you high, and won for you honors and rank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, <i>ma foi!</i> have they not done so? Am I not a very interesting
      individual at this moment,&mdash;more so than any other of my life? Are
      not half the powdered heads of the Faubourg plotting over my downfall, and
      wondering how they are to secure me to the 'true cause'? Are not the hot
      heads of the Jacobites speculating on my admission, by a unanimous vote,
      into their order? And has not Fouché gone to the special expense of a new
      police spy, solely destined to dine at the same café, play at the same <i>salon</i>,
      and sit in the same box of the Opera with me? Is this nothing? Well, it
      will be good fun, after all, to set their wise brains on the wrong track;
      not to speak of the happiness of weeding one's acquaintance, which a
      little turn of fortune always effects so instantaneously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would suppose from your manner, Duchesne, that some unlooked-for
      piece of good luck had befallen you; the event seems to have been the
      crowning one of your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not at liberty, boy? have I not thrown the slavery behind me? Is
      that nothing? You may fancy your collar, because there is some gold upon
      it; but, trust me, it galls the neck as cursedly as the veriest brass.
      Come, Burke, I must have a glass of champagne, and you must pledge me in a
      creaming bumper. If you don't join in the sentiment now, the time will
      come later on. We may be many a mile apart,&mdash;ay, perhaps a whole
      world will divide us; but you'll remember my toast,&mdash;'To him that is
      free!' I am sick of most things; women, wine, war, play,&mdash;the game of
      life itself, with all its dashing and existing interests,&mdash;I have had
      them to satiety. But liberty has its charm; even to the palsied arm and
      the withered hand freedom is dear; and why not to him who yet can strike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes flashed fire as he spoke, and he drained glass after glass of
      wine, without seeming aware of what he was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you felt thus, Duchesne, why have you remained so long a soldier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'll tell you. He who travels unwillingly along some dreary path stops
      often as he goes, and looks around to see if, in the sky above or the road
      beneath, some obstacle may not cross his way and bid him turn. The
      faintest sound of a brewing storm, the darkening shadow of a cloud, a
      swollen rivulet, is enough, and straightway he yields: so men seem swayed
      in life by trifles which never moved them, by accidents which came not
      near their hearts. These, which the world called their disappointments,
      were often but the pivots of their fortune. I have had enough, nay, more
      than enough, of all this. You must not ask the hackneyed actor of the
      melodrama to start at the blue lights, and feel real fear at burning
      forests and flaming châteaux. This mock passion of the Emperor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my friend, that is indeed too much; unquestionably there was no
      feigning there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duchesne gave a bitter laugh, and laying his hand on my arm, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good boy, I know him well. The knowledge has cost me something; but I
      have it. A soldier's enthusiasm!&rdquo; said he, in irony,&mdash;&ldquo;bah! Shall I
      tell you a little incident of my boyhood? I detest story-telling, but this
      you must hear. Fill my glass! listen, and I promise you not to be
      lengthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time in our intimacy in which Duchesne referred
      distinctly to his past life; and I willingly accepted the offer he made,
      anticipating that any incident, no matter how trivial, might throw a light
      on the strange contrarieties of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat for several minutes silent, his eyes turned towards the ground. A
      faint smile, more of sadness than aught else, played about his lips, as he
      muttered to himself some words I could not catch. Then rallying, with a
      slight effort, he began thus&mdash;But, short as his tale was, we must
      give him a chapter to himself.

      CHAPTER XIV. A BOYISH REMINISCENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I have already told you, Burke, that my family were most of
      them Royalists. Such as were engaged in trade followed the fortunes of the
      day, and cried 'Vive la République!' like their neighbors. Some deemed it
      better to emigrate, and wait in a foreign land for the happy hour of
      returning to their own,&mdash;a circumstance, by the way, which must have
      tried their patience ere this; and a few, trusting to their obscure
      position, living in out-of-the-way, remote spots, supposed that in the
      general uproar they might escape undetected; and, with one or two
      exceptions, they were right. Among these latter was an unmarried brother
      of my mother, who having held a military command for a great many years in
      the Ile de Bourbon, retired to spend the remainder of his days in a small
      but beautiful château on the seaside, about three leagues from Marseilles.
      The old viscount (we continued to call him so among ourselves, though the
      use of titles was proscribed long before) had met with some disappointment
      in love in early life, which had prevented his ever marrying, and turned
      all his affections towards the children of his brothers and sisters, who
      invariably passed a couple of months of each summer with him, arriving
      from different parts of France for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And truly it was a strange sight to see the mixture of look, expression,
      accent, and costume, that came to the rendezvous: the long-featured boy,
      with blue eyes and pointed chin,&mdash;cold, wary, and suspicious, brave
      but cautious,&mdash;that came from Normandy; the high-spirited, reckless
      youth from Brittany; the dark-eyed girl of Provence; the quick-tempered,
      warm-hearted Gascon and, stranger than all, from his contrast to the rest
      the little Parisian, with his airs of the capital and his contempt for his
      rustic brethren, nothing daunted that in all their boyish exercises he
      found himself so much their inferior. Our dear old uncle loved nothing so
      well as to have us around him; and even the little ones, of five and six
      years old, when not living too far off, were brought to these reunions,
      which were to us the great events of each year of our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in the June of the year 1794&mdash;I shall not easily forget the
      date&mdash;that we were all assembled as usual at 'Le Luc.' Our party was
      reinforced by some three or four new visitors, among whom was a little
      girl of about twelve years old,&mdash;Annette de Noailles, the prettiest
      creature I ever beheld. Every land has its own trait of birth distinctly
      marked. I don't know whether you have observed that the brow and the
      forehead are more indicative of class in Frenchmen than any other portion
      of the face: hers was perfect, and though a mere child, conveyed an
      impression of tempered decision and mildness that was most fascinating;
      the character of her features was thoughtful, and were it not for a
      certain vivacity in the eyes, would have been even sad. Forgive me, if I
      dwell&mdash;when I need not&mdash;on these traits: she is no more. Her
      father carried her with him in his exile, and your lowering skies and
      gloomy air soon laid her low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annette was the child of Royalist parents. Both her father and mother had
      occupied places in the royal household; and she was accustomed from her
      earliest infancy to hear the praise of the Bourbons from lips which
      trembled when they spoke. Poor child! how well do I remember her little
      prayer for the martyred saint,&mdash;for so they styled the murdered king,&mdash;which
      she never missed saying each morning when the mass was over in the chapel
      of the château. It is a curious fact that the girls of a family were
      frequently attached to the fortunes of the Bourbons, while the boys
      declared for the Revolution; and these differences penetrated into the
      very core, and sapped the happiness of many whose affection had stood the
      test of every misfortune save the uprooting torrent of anarchy that poured
      in with the Revolution. These party differences entered into all the
      little quarrels of the schoolroom and the nursery; and the taunting
      epithets of either side were used in angry passion by those who neither
      guessed nor could understand their meaning. Need it be wondered at, if in
      after life these opinions took the tone of intense convictions, when even
      thus in infancy they were nurtured and fostered? Our little circle at Le
      Luc was, indeed, wonderfully free from such causes of contention; whatever
      paths in life fate had in store for us afterwards, then, at least, we were
      of one mind. A few of the boys, it is true, were struck by the successes
      of those great armies the Revolution poured over Europe; but even they
      were half ashamed to confess enthusiasm in a cause so constantly allied in
      their memory with everything mean and low-lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such, in a few words, was the little party assembled around the
      supper-table of the château, on one lovely evening in June. The windows,
      opening to the ground, let in the perfumed air from many a sweet and
      flowery shrub without; while already the nightingale had begun her lay in
      the deep grove hard by. The evening was so calm we could hear the plash of
      the making tide upon the shore, and the minute peals of the waves smote on
      the ear with a soft and melancholy cadence that made us silent and
      thoughtful. As we sat for some minutes thus, we suddenly heard the sound
      of feet coming up the little gravel walk towards the château, and on going
      to the window, perceived three men in uniform leading their horses slowly
      along. The dusky light prevented our being able to distinguish their rank
      or condition; but my uncle, whose fears were easily excited by such
      visitors, at once hastened to the door to receive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His absence was not of many minutes' duration; but even now I can
      remember the strange sensations of dread that rendered us all speechless
      as we stood looking towards the door by which he was to enter. He came at
      last, and was followed by two officers; one, the elder, and the superior
      evidently, was a thin, slight man, of about thirty, with a pale but stern
      countenance, in which a certain haughty expression predominated; the other
      was a fine, soldierlike, frank-looking fellow, who saluted us all as he
      came in with a smile and a pleasant gesture of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You may leave us, children,' said my uncle, as he proceeded towards the
      bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You were at supper, if I mistake not?' said the elder of the two
      officers, with a degree of courtesy in his tone I scarcely expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, General. But my little friends&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Will, I hope, share with us,' said the general, interrupting; 'and I, at
      least, am determined, with your permission, that they shall remain. It is
      quite enough that we enjoy the hospitality of your château for the night,
      without interfering with the happiness of its inmates; and I beg that we
      may give you as little inconvenience as possible in providing for our
      accommodation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though these words were spoken with an easy and a kindly tone, there was
      a cold, distant manner in the speaker that chilled us all, and while we
      drew over to the table again, it was in silence and constraint. Indeed,
      our poor uncle looked the very picture of dismay, endeavoring to do the
      honors to his guests and seem at ease, while it was clear his fears were
      ever uppermost in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The aide-de-camp&mdash;for such the young officer was&mdash;looked like
      one who could have been agreeable and amusing if the restraint of the
      general's presence was not over him. As it was, he spoke in a low, subdued
      voice, and seemed in great awe of his superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unlike our usual ones, the meal was eaten in mournful stillness, the very
      youngest amongst us feeling the presence of the stranger as a thing of
      gloom and sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper over, my uncle, perhaps hoping to relieve the embarrassment he
      labored under, asked permission of the general for us to remain, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My little people, sir, are great novelists, and they usually amuse me of
      an evening by their stories. Will this be too great an endurance for you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'By no means,' said the general, gayly; 'there's nothing I like better,
      and I hope they will admit me as one of the party. I have something of a
      gift that way myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The circle was soon formed, the general and his aide-de-camp making part
      of it; but though they both exerted themselves to the utmost to win our
      confidence, I know not why or wherefore, we could not shake off the gloom
      we had felt at first, but sat awkward and ill at ease, unable to utter a
      word, and even ashamed to look at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come,' said the general, 'I see how it is. I have broken in upon a very
      happy party. I must make the only <i>amende</i> in my power,&mdash;I shall
      be the story-teller for this evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he said this, he looked around the little circle, and by some seeming
      magic of his own, in an instant he had won us every one. We drew our
      chairs close towards him, and listened eagerly for his tale. Few people,
      save such as live much among children, or take the trouble to study their
      tone of feeling and thinking, are aware how far reality surpasses in
      interest the force of mere fiction. The fact is with them far more than
      all the art of the narrative; and if you cannot say 'this was true,' more
      than half of the pleasure your story confers is lost forever. Whether the
      general knew this, or that his memory supplied him more easily than his
      imagination, I cannot say; but his tale was a little incident of the siege
      of Toulon, where a drummer boy was killed,&mdash;having returned to the
      breach, after the attack was repulsed, to seek for a little cockade of
      ribbon his mother had fastened on his cap that morning. Simple as was the
      story, he told it with a subdued and tender pathos that made our hearts
      thrill and filled every eye around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It was a poor thing, it's true,' said he, 'that knot of ribbon, but it
      was glory to him to rescue it from the enemy. His heart was on the time
      when he should show it, blood-stained and torn, and say, &ldquo;I took it from
      the ground amid the grapeshot and the musketry. I was the only living
      thing there that moment; and see, I bore it away triumphantly.&rdquo;' As the
      general spoke, he unbuttoned the breast of his uniform, and took forth a
      small piece of crumpled ribbon, fastened in the shape of a cockade. 'Here
      it is,' said he, holding it up before on? eyes; 'it was for this he died.'
      We could scarce see it through our tears. Poor Annette held her hands upon
      her face, and sobbed violently. 'Keep it, my sweet child,' said the
      general, as he attached the cockade to her shoulder;' it is a glorious
      emblem, and well worthy to be worn by one so pure and so fair as you are.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annette looked up, and as she did, her eyes fell upon the tricolor that
      hung from her shoulder,&mdash;the hated, the despised tricolor, the badge
      of that party whose cruelty she had thought of by day and dreamed of by
      night. She turned deadly pale, and sat, with lips compressed and clenched
      hands, unable to speak or stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What is it? Are you ill, child?' said the general, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Annette, love! Annette, dearest!' said my uncle, trembling with anxiety,
      'speak; what is the matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It is that!' cried I, fiercely, pointing to the knot, on which her eyes
      were bent with a shrinking horror I well knew the meaning of,&mdash;' it
      is that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The general bent on me a look of passionate meaning, as with a hissing
      tone he said, 'Do you mean this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' said I, tearing it away, and trampling it beneath my feet,&mdash;'yes!
      it is not a Noailles can wear the badge of infamy and crime; the
      blood-stained tricolor can find slight favor here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Hush, boy! hush, for Heaven's sake!' cried my uncle, trembling with
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The caution came too late. The general, taking a note-book from his
      pocket, opened it leisurely, and then turning towards the viscount, said,
      'This youth's name is&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Duchesne; Henri Duchesne.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And his age?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Fourteen in March,' replied my uncle, as his eyes filled up; while he
      added, in a half whisper, 'if you mean the conscription, General, he has
      already supplied a substitute.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No matter, sir, if he had sent twenty; such defect of education as his
      needs correction. He shall join the levies at Toulon in three days; in
      three days, mark me! Depend upon it, sir,' said he, turning to me, 'you
      shall learn a lesson beneath that tricolor you'll be somewhat long in
      forgetting. Dumolle, look to this.' With this direction to his
      aide-de-camp he arose, and before my poor unhappy uncle could recover his
      self-possession to reply, had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He will not do this, sir; surely, he will not,' said the viscount to the
      young officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'General Bonaparte does not relent, sir; and if he did, he 'd never show
      it,' was the cold reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That day week I carried a musket on the ramparts of Toulon. Here began a
      career I have followed ever since; with how much of enthusiasm I leave you
      to judge for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Duchesne concluded this little story he arose, and paced the room
      backwards and forwards with rapid steps, while his compressed lips and
      knitted brow showed he was lost in gloomy recollections of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was right, after all, Burke,&rdquo; said he, at length. &ldquo;Personal honor will
      make the soldier; conviction may make the patriot. I fought as stoutly for
      this same cause as though I did not loathe it: how many others may be in
      the same position? You yourself, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; not I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be it so,&rdquo; rejoined he, carelessly. &ldquo;Goodnight&rdquo; And with that he
      strolled negligently from the room, and I heard him humming a tune as he
      mounted the stairs towards his bedroom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. A GOOD-BY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to bring you a card for the Court ball, Capitaine,&rdquo; said
      General Daru, as he opened the door of my dressing-room the following
      morning. &ldquo;See what a number of them I have here; but except your own, the
      addresses are not filled up. You are in favor at the Tuileries, it would
      seem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware of my good fortune, General,&rdquo; replied I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be assured, however, it is such,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;These things are not, as so
      many deem them, mere matters of chance; every name is well weighed and
      conned over: the officers of the household serve one who does not forgive
      mistakes. And now that I think of it, you were intimate&mdash;very
      intimate, I believe&mdash;with Duchesne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; we were much together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, after what has occurred, I need scarcely say your
      acquaintance with him had better cease. There is no middle course in these
      matters. Circumstances will not bring you, as formerly, into each other's
      company; and to continue your intimacy would be offensive to his Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely, sir, the friendship of persons so humble as we are can be a
      subject neither for the Emperor's satisfaction nor displeasure, if he even
      were to know of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take my word for that,&rdquo; replied the general, somewhat sternly.
      &ldquo;The counsel I have given to-day may come as a command to-morrow. The
      Chevalier Duchesne has given his Majesty great and grave offence; see that
      you are not led to follow his example.&rdquo; With a marked emphasis on the last
      few words, and with a cold bow, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I am not led to follow his example!&rdquo; said I, repeating his words
      over slowly to myself. &ldquo;Is that, then, the danger of which he would warn
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remembrance of the misfortunes which opened my career in life came
      full before me,&mdash;the unhappy acquaintance with De Beauvais, and the
      long train of suspicious circumstances that followed; and I shuddered at
      the bare thought of being again involved in apparent criminality. And yet,
      what a state of slavery was this! The thought flashed suddenly across my
      mind, and I exclaimed aloud, &ldquo;And this is the liberty for which I have
      perilled life and limb,&mdash;this the cause for which I have become an
      alien and an exile!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most true, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Duchesne, gayly, as he slipped into the
      room, and drew his Chair towards the fire. &ldquo;A wise reflection, but most
      unwisely spoken. But there are men nothing can teach; not even the
      'Temple' nor the 'Palais de Justice.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, then,&mdash;you know of my unhappy imprisonment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know of it? To be sure I do. Bless your sweet innocence! I have been
      told, a hundred times over, to make overtures to you from the Faubourg.
      There are at least a dozen old ladies there who believe firmly you are a
      true Legitimist, and wear the white cockade next your heart. I have had,
      over and over, the most tempting offers to make you. Faith, I 'm not quite
      certain if we are not believed to be, at this very moment, concocting how
      to smuggle over the frontier a brass carronade and a royal livery, two
      pounds of gunpowder and a court periwig, to restore the Bourbons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He burst into a fit of laughing as he concluded; and however little
      disposed to mirth at the moment, I could not refrain from joining in the
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now for a moment of serious consideration, Burke; for I can be
      serious at times, at least when my friends are concerned. You and I must
      part here; it is all the better for you it should be so. I am what the
      world is pleased to call a 'dangerous companion;' and there's more truth
      in the epithet than they wot of who employ it. It is not because I am a
      man of pleasure, and occasionally a man of expensive habits and costly
      tastes, nor that I now and then play deep, or drink deep, or follow up
      with passionate determination any ruling propensity of the moment; but
      because I am a discontented and unsettled man, who has a vague ambition of
      being something he knows not what, by means he knows not how,&mdash;ever
      willing to throw himself into an enterprise where the prize is great and
      the risk greater, and yet never able to warm his wishes into enthusiasm
      nor his belief into a conviction: in a word, a Frenchman, born a
      Legitimist, reared a Democrat, educated an Imperialist, and turned adrift
      upon the world a scoffer. Such men as I am are dangerous companions; and
      when they increase, as they are likely to do in our state of society, will
      be still more dangerous citizens. But come, my good friend, don't look
      dismayed, nor distend your nostrils as if you were on the scent for a
      smell of brimstone,&mdash;'Satan s'en va!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he arose and held out his hand to me. &ldquo;Don't let your
      Napoleonite ardor ooze out too rapidly, Burke, and you 'll be a marshal of
      France yet. There are great prizes in the wheel, to be had by those who
      strive for them. Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we shall meet, Duchesne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. The time may come, perhaps, when we may be intimate without
      alarming the police of the department. But, for the present, I am about to
      leave Paris; some friends in the South have been kind enough to invite me
      to visit them, and I start this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We shook hands once more, and Duchesne moved towards the door; then,
      turning suddenly about, he said, &ldquo;Apropos of another matter,&mdash;this
      Mademoiselle de Lacostellerie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of her?&rdquo; said I, with some curiosity in my tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I have a kind of half suspicion, ripening into something like an
      assurance, that when we meet again she may be Madame Burke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense, my dear friend! the absurdity&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is none whatever. An acquaintance begun like yours is very
      suggestive of such a termination. When the lady is saucy and the gentleman
      shy, the game stands usually thus: the one needs control and the other
      lacks courage. Let them change the cards, and see what comes of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong, Duchesne,&mdash;all wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so. I have been so often right, I can afford a false prediction
      without losing all my character as prophet. Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was I alone than I sat down to think over what he had said. The
      improbability, nay, as it seemed to me, the all but impossibility, of such
      an event as he foretold, seemed not less now than when first I heard it;
      but somehow I felt a kind of internal satisfaction, a sense of gratified
      vanity, to think that to so acute an observer as Duchesne such a
      circumstance did not appear even unreasonable. How hard it is to call in
      reason against the assault of flattery! How difficult to resist the force
      of an illusion by any appeal to our good sense and calmer judgment!
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed from this that I seriously contemplated such a
      possible turn of fortune,&mdash;far less wished for it. No; my
      satisfaction had a different source. It lay in the thought that I, the
      humble captain of hussars, should ever be thought of as the suitor of the
      greatest beauty and the richest dowry of the day: here was the mainspring
      of my flattered pride. As to any other feeling, I had none. I admired
      Mademoiselle de Lacostellerie greatly; she was, perhaps, the very
      handsomest girl I ever saw; there was not one in the whole range of
      Parisian society so much sought after; and there was a degree of
      distinction in being accounted even among the number of her admirers.
      Besides this, there lay a lurking desire in my heart that Marie de Meudon
      (for as such only could I think of her) should hear me thus spoken of. It
      seemed to me like a weak revenge on her own indifference to me; and I
      longed to make anything a cause of connecting my fate with the idea of her
      who yet held my whole heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only men who live much to themselves and their own thoughts know the
      pleasure of thus linking their fortunes, by some imaginary chain, to that
      of those they love. They are the straws that drowning men catch at; but
      still, for the moment, they sustain the sinking courage, and nerve the
      heart where all is failing. I felt this acutely. I knew well that she was
      not, nor could be, anything to me; but I knew, also, that to divest my
      mind of her image was to live in darkness, and that the mere chance of
      being remembered by her was happiness itself. It was while hearing of her
      I first imbibed the soldier's ardor from her own brother. She herself had
      placed before me the glorious triumphs of that career in words that never
      ceased to ring in my ears. All my hopes of distinction, my aspirations for
      success, were associated with the half prediction she had uttered; and I
      burned for an occasion by which I could signalize myself,&mdash;that she
      might read my name, perchance might say, &ldquo;And <i>he</i> loved me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In such a world of dreamy thought I passed day after day. Duchesne was
      gone, and I had no intimate companion to share my hours with, nor with
      whom I could expand in social freedom. Meanwhile, the gay life of the
      capital continued its onward course; fêtes and balls succeeded each other;
      and each night I found myself a guest at some splendid entertainment, but
      where I neither knew nor was known to any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on one morning, after a very magnificent fête at the
      Arch-Chancellor's, that I remembered, for the first time, I had not seen
      my poor friend Pioche since his arrival at Paris. A thrill of shame ran
      through me at the thought of having neglected to ask after my old comrade
      of the march, and I ordered my horse at once, to set out for the
      Hôtel-Dieu, which had now been in great part devoted to the wounded
      soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was a fine one for the season; and as I entered the large
      courtyard I perceived numbers of the invalids moving about in groups, to
      enjoy the air and the sun of a budding spring. Poor fellows! they were but
      the mere remnants of humanity. Several had lost both legs, and few were
      there without an empty sleeve to their loose blue coats. In a large hall,
      where three long tables were being laid for dinner, many were seated
      around the ample fireplaces; and at one of these a larger group than
      ordinary attracted my attention. They were not chatting and laughing, like
      the rest, but apparently in deep silence. I approached, curious to know
      the reason; and then perceived that they were all listening attentively to
      some one reading aloud. The tones of the voice were familiar to me; I
      stopped to hear them more plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Minette herself&mdash;the vivandière&mdash;who sat there in the
      midst; beside her, half reclining in a deep, old-fashioned armchair, was
      &ldquo;le gros Pioche,&rdquo; his huge beard descending midway on his chest, and his
      great mustache curling below his upper lip. He had greatly rallied since I
      saw him last, but still showed signs of debility and feebleness by the
      very attitude in which he lay.
    </p>

      <img src="images/194.jpg" alt="194 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Mingling unperceived with the crowd, who were far too highly interested in
      the recital to pay any attention to my approach, I listened patiently, and
      soon perceived that mademoiselle was reading some incident of the Egyptian
      campaign from one of those innumerable volumes which then formed the sole
      literature of the garrison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The redoubt,&rdquo; continued Minette, &ldquo;was strongly defended in front by
      stockades and a ditch, while twelve pieces of artillery and a force of
      seven hundred Mamelukes were within the works. Suddenly an aide-de-camp
      arrived at full gallop, with orders for the Thirty-second to attack the
      redoubt with the bayonet, and carry it. The major of the regiment (the
      colonel had been killed that morning at the ford) cried out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Grenadiers, you hear the order,&mdash;Forward!' But the same instant a
      terrible discharge of grape tore through the ranks, killing three and
      wounding eight others. 'Forward, men! forward!' shouted the major. But no
      one stirred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tête d'enfer</i>,&rdquo; growled out Pioche, &ldquo;where was the tambour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall hear,&rdquo; said Minette, and resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Do you hear me?' cried the major, 'or am I to be disgraced forever?
      Advance&mdash;quick time&mdash;march!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But, Major,' said a sergeant, aloud, 'they are not roasted apples those
      fellows yonder are pelting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Silence!' called out the major; 'not a word! Tambour, beat the charge!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly a man sprang up to his knees from the ground where he had been
      lying, and began to beat the drum with all his might. Poor fellow! his leg
      was smashed with a shot, but he obeyed his orders in the midst of all his
      suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Forward, men! forward!' cried the major, waving his cap above his head.
      'Fix bayonets&mdash;charge!' And on they dashed after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Halloo, comrades!' shouted the tambour; 'don't leave me behind you.' And
      in an instant two grenadiers stooped down and hoisted him on their
      shoulders, and then rushed forward through the smoke and flame. Crashing
      and smashing went the shot through the leading files; but on they went,
      leaping over the dead and dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the tambour still?&rdquo; asked Pioche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Minette; &ldquo;there he was. But listen:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as they reached the breach a shot above their heads came whizzing
      past, and a terrible bang rang out as it went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He is killed,' said one of the grenadiers, preparing to lower the body;
      'I heard his cry.'
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Not yet, Comrade,' cried the tambour; 'it is the drum-head they have
      carried away, that's all;' and he beat away on the wooden sides harder
      than ever. And thus they bore him over the glacis, and up the rampart, and
      never stopped till they placed him, sitting, on one of the guns on the
      wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah! well done!&rdquo; cried Pioche; while every throat around him re-echoed
      the cry, &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was his name, Mademoiselle?&rdquo; cried several voices. &ldquo;Tell us the name
      of the tambour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi, Messieurs!</i>they have not given it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not given his name,&rdquo; growled they out. &ldquo;<i>Ventrebleu!</i> that is too
      bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An he had been an officer of the Guard they would have told us his whole
      birth and parentage,&rdquo; said a wrinkled, sour-looking old fellow, with one
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a lieutenant of hussars, Mademoiselle!&rdquo; said Pioche, looking fixedly
      at the vivandière, who held the book close to her face to conceal a deep
      blush that covered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, halloo, there! Qui vive?&rdquo; The cuirassier had just caught a glimpse
      of me at the moment, and every eye was turned at once to where I was
      standing. &ldquo;Ah, Lieutenant, you here! Not invalided, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pioche. My visit was intended for you; and I have had the good
      fortune to come in for the tale mademoiselle was reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I had concluded these few words, the wounded soldiers, or such of
      them as could, had risen from their seats, and stood respectfully around
      me; while Minette, retreating behind the great chair where Pioche lay,
      seemed to wish to avoid recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Front rank, Mademoiselle! front rank!&rdquo; said Pioche. &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i>when
      one has the 'cross of the Legion' from the hands of the Emperor himself,
      one need not be ashamed of being seen. Besides,&rdquo; added he, in a lower
      tone, but one I could well overhear, &ldquo;thou art not dressed in thy uniform
      now; thou hast nothing to blush for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still she hung down her head, and her confusion seemed only to increase;
      so that, unwilling to prolong her embarrassment, which I saw my presence
      had caused, I merely made a few inquiries from Pioche regarding his own
      health, and took my leave of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I rode homeward, I could not help turning over in my mind the words of
      Pioche, &ldquo;Thou art not in thy uniform now; thou hast nothing to blush for!&rdquo;
       Here, then, seemed the key to the changed manner of the poor girl when I
      met her at Austerlitz,&mdash;some feeling of womanly shame at being seen
      in the costume of the vivandière by one who had known her only in another
      guise. But could this be so? I asked myself,&mdash;a question a very
      little knowledge of a woman's heart might have spared me. And thus
      pondering, I returned to the Luxembourg.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. AN OLD FRIEND UNCHANGED
    </h2>
    <p>
      They who took their tone in politics from the public journals of France
      must have been somewhat puzzled at the new and unexpected turn of the
      papers in Government influence at the period I now speak of. The
      tremendous attacks against the &ldquo;perfide Albion,&rdquo; which constituted the
      staple of the leading articles in the &ldquo;Moniteur,&rdquo; were gradually
      discontinued; the great body of the people were separated from the
      &ldquo;tyrannical domination of an insolent aristocracy;&rdquo; an occasional eulogy
      would appear, too, upon the &ldquo;native good sense and right feeling of John
      Bull&rdquo; when not led captive by appeals to his passions and prejudices; and
      at last a wish more boldly expressed that the two countries, whose mission
      it should be to disseminate civilization over the earth, could so far
      understand their real interest as to become &ldquo;fast friends, instead of
      dangerous enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The accession of the Whigs to power in England was the cause of this
      sudden revolution. The Emperor, when First Consul, had learned to know and
      admire Charles Fox,&mdash;sentiments of mutual esteem had grown up between
      them,&mdash;and it seemed now as if his elevation to power were the only
      thing wanting to establish friendly relations between the two countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      How far the French Emperor presumed on Fox's liberalism,&mdash;and the
      strong bias to party inducing him to adopt such a line of policy as would
      run directly counter to that of his predecessors in office, and thus
      dispose the nation to more amicable views towards France,&mdash;certain it
      is that he miscalculated considerably when he built upon any want of true
      English feeling on the part of that minister, or any tendency to weaken,
      by unjust concessions, the proud attitude England had assumed at the
      commencement and maintained throughout the entire Continental war.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mere accident led to a renewal of negotiations between the two
      countries. A villain, calling himself Guillet de la Grevillière, had the
      audacity to propose to the English minister the assassination of Napoleon,
      and to offer himself for the deed. He had hired a house at Passy, and made
      every preparation for the execution of his foul scheme. To denounce this
      wretch to the French minister of foreign affairs, Talleyrand, was the
      first step of Fox. This led to a reply, in which Talleyrand reported, word
      for word, a conversation that passed between the Emperor and himself, and
      wherein expressions of the kindest nature were employed by Napoleon with
      regard to Fox, and many flattering allusions to the times of their former
      intimacy; the whole concluding with the expression of an ardent desire for
      a good understanding and a &ldquo;lasting peace between two nations designed by
      nature to esteem each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although the whole scheme of the assassination was a police stratagem
      devised by Fouché to test the honor and good faith of the English
      minister, the result was eagerly seized on as a basis for new
      negotiations; and from that hour the temperate language of the French
      papers evinced a new policy towards England. The insolent allusions of
      journalists, the satirical squibs of party writers, the caricatures of the
      English eccentricity, were suppressed at once; and by that magic influence
      which Napoleon wielded, the whole tone of public feeling seemed altered as
      regarded England and Englishmen. From the leaders in the &ldquo;Moniteur&rdquo; to the
      shop windows of the Palace an Anglomania prevailed; and the idea was
      thrown out that the two nations had divided the world between them,&mdash;the
      sea being the empire of the British, the land that of Frenchmen.
      Commissioners were appointed on both sides: at first Lord Yarmouth, and
      then Lord Lauderdale, by England; General Clarke and M. Champagny, on the
      part of France. Lord Yarmouth, at that time a <i>détenu</i> at Verdun, was
      selected by Talleyrand to proceed to England, and learn the precise basis
      on which an amicable negotiation could be founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely was the interchange of correspondence made public, when the new
      tone of feeling and acting towards England displayed itself in every
      circle and every <i>salon</i>. If a proof were wanting how thoroughly the
      despotism of Napoleon had penetrated into the very core of society, here
      was a striking one: not only were many of the <i>détenus</i> liberated and
      sent back to England, but were fêted and entertained at the various towns
      they stopped at on their way, and every expedient practised to make them
      satisfied with the treatment they had received on the soil of France. An
      English guest was deemed an irresistible attraction at a dinner party, and
      the most absurd attempts at imitation of English habits, dress, and
      language were introduced into society as the last &ldquo;mode,&rdquo; and extolled as
      the very pinnacle of fashionable excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be easy for me here to cite some strange instances of this new
      taste; but I already feel that I have wandered from my own path, and owe
      an apology to my reader for invading precincts which scarce become me. Yet
      may I observe here,&mdash;and the explanation will serve once for all,&mdash;I
      have been more anxious in this &ldquo;true history&rdquo; to preserve some passing
      record of the changeful features of an eventful period in Europe, than
      merely to chronicle personal adventures, which, although not devoid of
      vicissitudes, are still so insignificant in the great events by which they
      were surrounded. The Consulate, the Empire, and the Restoration were three
      great tableaux, differing in their groupings and color, but each part of
      one mighty whole,&mdash;links in the great chain, and evidencing the
      changeful aspect of a nation crouching beneath tyranny, or dwindling under
      imbecility and dotage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said the English were the vogue in Paris; and so they were, but
      especially in those <i>salons</i> which reflected the influence of the
      Court, and where the tone of the Tuileries was revered as law. Every
      member of the Government, or all who were even remotely connected with it,
      at once adopted the reigning mode; and to be <i>à l'Anglaise</i> became
      now as much the type of fashion as ever it had been directly the opposite.
      Only such as were in the confidence of Fouché and his schemes knew how
      hollow all this display of friendly feeling was, or how ready the
      Government held themselves to assume their former attitude of defiance
      when circumstances should render it advisable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who speedily took up the tone of the Imperial counsels, the <i>salons</i>
      of the Hôtel Glichy were conspicuous. English habits, as regarded table
      equipage; English servants; even to English cookery did French politeness
      extend its complaisance; and many of the commonest habitudes and least
      cultivated tastes were imported as the daily observances of fashionable
      people <i>outremer</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this headlong Anglomania, my English birth and family (I say English,
      because abroad the petty distinctions of Irishman or Scotchman are not
      attended to) marked me out for peculiar attention in society; and although
      my education and residence in France had well-nigh rubbed off all or the
      greater part of my national peculiarities, yet the flatterers of the day
      found abundant traits to admire in what they recognized as my John Bull
      characteristics. And in this way, a blunder in French, a mistake in
      grammar, or a false accentuation became actually a <i>succès de salon</i>.
      Though I could not help smiling at the absurdity of a vogue whose violence
      alone indicated its unlikeliness to last, yet I had sufficient of the
      spirit of my adopted country to benefit by it while it did exist, and
      never spent a single day out of company.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Hôtel Clichy I was a constant guest; and while with Mademoiselle de
      Lacostellerie my acquaintance made little progress, with the countess I
      became a special favorite,&mdash;she honoring me so far as to take me into
      her secret counsels, and tell me all the little nothings which Fouché
      usually disseminated as state secrets, and circulated twice or thrice a
      week throughout Paris. From him, too, she learned the names of the various
      English who each day arrived in Paris from Verdun, and thus contrived to
      have a succession of those favored guests at her dinner and evening
      parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this time, as I have said, my intimacy with mademoiselle
      advanced but slowly, and certainly showed slight prospect of verifying the
      prophecy of Duchesne at parting. Her manner had, indeed, lost its cold and
      haughty tone; but in lieu of it there was a flippant, half impertinent, <i>moqueur</i>
      spirit, which, however easily turned to advantage by a man of the world
      like the chevalier, was terribly disconcerting to a less forward and less
      enterprising person like myself. Dobretski still continued an invalid; and
      although she never mentioned his name nor alluded to him in any instance,
      I could see that she suspected I knew something more of his illness and
      the cause of it than I had ever confessed. It matters little what the
      subject of it be, let a secret once exist between a young man and a young
      woman,&mdash;let there be the tacit understanding that they mutually know
      of something of which others are in ignorance,&mdash;and from that moment
      a species of intelligence is established between them of the most
      dangerous kind. They may not be disposed to like each other; there may be
      attachments elsewhere; there may be a hundred reasons why love should not
      enter into the case; yet will there be a conscious sense of this hidden
      link which binds them; strangely at variance with their ordinary regard
      for each other, eternally mingling in all their intercourse, and
      suggesting modes of acting and thinking at variance with the true tenor of
      the acquaintanceship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, then, was my position at the Hôtel Clichy, at which I was almost
      daily a visitor or a guest, in the morning, to hear the chit-chat of the
      day,&mdash;the changes talked of in the administration, the intended plans
      of the Emperor, or the last modes in dress introduced by the Empress,
      whose taste in costume and extravagant habits were much more popular with
      the tradespeople than with Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      An illness of a few days' duration had confined me to the Luxembourg, and
      unhappily deprived me of the Court ball, for which I had received my
      invitation several weeks before. It seemed as if my fate forbade any
      chance of my ever seeing her once more whose presence in Paris was the
      great hope I held out to myself when coming. Already a rumor was afloat
      that several officers had received orders to join their regiments; and now
      I began to fear lest I should leave the capital without meeting her, and
      was thinking of some plan by which I could attain that object, when a note
      arrived from Mademoiselle de Lacostellerie, written with more than her
      usual cordiality, and inviting me to dinner on the following day with a
      very small party, but when I should meet one of my oldest friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of every one in turn who could be meant under the designation,
      but without ever satisfying my mind that I had hit upon the right one.
      Tascher it could not be, for the very last accounts I had seen from
      Germany spoke of him as with his regiment. My curiosity was sufficiently
      excited to make me accept the invitation; and, true to time, I found
      myself at the Hôtel Clichy at the hour appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the <i>salon</i>, I discovered that I was alone. None of the
      guests had as yet arrived, nor had the ladies of the house made their
      appearance; and I lounged about the splendid drawing-room, where every
      appliance of luxury was multiplied: pictures, vases, statues, and bronzes
      abounded,&mdash;for the apartment had all the ample proportions of a
      gallery,&mdash;battle scenes from the great «vents of the Italian and
      Egyptian campaigns; busts of celebrated generals and portraits of several
      of the marshals, from the pencils of Gerard and David. But more than all
      was I struck by one picture: it was a likeness of Pauline herself, in the
      costume of a Spanish peasant. Never had artist caught more of the
      character of his subject than in that brilliant sketch,&mdash;for it was
      no more. The proud tone of the expression; the large, full eye, beaming a
      bright defiance; the haughty curl of the lip; the determined air of the
      figure, as she stood one foot in advance, and the arms hanging easily on
      either side,&mdash;all conveyed an impression of high resolve and proud
      determination quite her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was leaning over the back of a chair, my eye steadfastly fixed on the
      painting, when I heard a slight rustling of a dress near me. I turned
      about: it was mademoiselle herself. Although the light of the apartment
      was tempered by the closed jalousies, and scarcely more than a mere
      twilight admitted, I could perceive that she colored and seemed confused
      as she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you don't think that picture is a likeness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said I, hesitatingly, &ldquo;there is much that reminds me of you; I
      mean, I can discover&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it frankly, sir; you think that saucy look is not from mere fancy. I
      deemed you a closer observer; but no matter. You have been ill; I trust
      you are recovered again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a mere passing indisposition, which unfortunately came at the moment
      of the Court ball. You were there, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it was there we had the pleasure to meet your friend, the general:
      but perhaps this is indiscreet on my part; I believe, indeed, I promised
      to say nothing of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The general! Do you mean General d'Auvergne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That much I will answer you,&mdash;I do not. But ask me no more
      questions. Your patience will not be submitted to a long trial; he dines
      with us to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no reply, but began to ponder over in my mind who the general in
      question could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! pray do not worry yourself about what a few moments will reveal
      for you, without any guessing. How strange it is, the intense feeling of
      curiosity people are afflicted with who themselves have secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have none, Mademoiselle; at least, none worth the telling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied she, saucily. &ldquo;But here come our guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several persons entered the <i>salon</i> at this moment, with each of whom
      I was slightly acquainted; they were either members of the Government or
      generals on the staff. The countess herself soon after made her
      appearance; and now we only waited for the individual so distinctively
      termed &ldquo;my friend&rdquo; to complete the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pauline has kept our secret, I hope,&rdquo; said the countess to me. &ldquo;I shall
      be sadly disappointed if anything mars this surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;Or is the whole thing some piece of badinage
      got up at my expense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the notion struck me, when a servant flung wide the
      folding-doors, and announced &ldquo;le Général&rdquo; somebody, but so mumbled was the
      word, the nearest thing I could make of it was &ldquo;Bulletin.&rdquo; This time,
      however, my curiosity suffered no long delay; for quickly after the
      announcement a portly personage in an English uniform entered hastily, and
      approaching madame, kissed her hand with a most gallant air; then turning
      to mademoiselle, he performed a similar ceremony. All this time my eyes
      were riveted upon him, without my being able to make the most remote guess
      as to who he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I introduce you, gentlemen?&rdquo; said the countess: &ldquo;Captain Burke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what! my old friend, my boy Tom! This you, with all that mustache?
      Delighted to see you,&rdquo; cried the large unknown, grasping me by the hands,
      and shaking them with a cordiality I had not known for many a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am but too happy to be recognized; but a most
      unfortunate memory&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Memory, lad! I never forgot anything in life. I remember the doctor
      shaking the snow off his boots the night I was born; a devilish cold
      December. We lived at Benhungeramud, in the Himalaya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;is this Captain Bubbleton, my old and kind friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General, Tom,&mdash;Lieutenant-General Bubbleton, with your leave,&rdquo; said
      he, correcting me. &ldquo;How the boy has grown! I remember him when he was
      scarce so high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear captain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General, lieutenant-general&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lieutenant-General,&mdash;to what happy chance do we owe the
      pleasure of seeing you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War, boy,&mdash;the old story. But we shall have time enough to talk over
      these things; and I see we are detaining the countess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the general gave his arm to madame, and led the way towards the
      dinner; whither we followed,&mdash;I in a state of surprise and
      astonishment that left me unable to collect my faculties for a
      considerable time after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the party, with the exception of Bubbleton, were French, he
      himself, as was his wont, supported nearly the whole of the conversation;
      and if his French was none of the most accurate, he amply made up in
      volubility for all accidents of grammar. It appeared that he had been
      three years at Verdun, a prisoner; though how he came there, whence, and
      at what exact period, there was no discovering. And now his arrival at
      Paris was an event equally shrouded in mystery, for no negotiations had
      been opened for his exchange whatsoever; but he had had the eloquence to
      persuade the préfet that the omission was a mere accident,&mdash;some
      blunder of the War-Office people, which he would rectify on his arrival at
      Paris. And there he was, though with what prospect of reaching England
      none but one of his inventive genius could possibly guess. He was brimful
      of politics, ministerial secrets, state news, and Government intentions,
      not only as regarded England, but Austria and Russia: and communicated in
      deep confidence a grand scheme by which the Fox ministry were to
      immortalize themselves,&mdash;which was by giving up Malta to the
      Bourbons, Louis the Eighteenth to be king, Goza to be a kind of dependency
      to be governed by a lieutenant-general whom &ldquo;he would not name;&rdquo; finishing
      his glass with an ominous look as he spoke. Thence he wandered on to his
      repugnance to state, and dislike to any government, function,&mdash;illustrating
      his quiet tastes and simple habits by recounting a career of Oriental
      luxury in which he described himself as living for years past; every word
      he spoke, whatever the impression on others, bringing me back most
      forcibly to my boyish days in the old barrack, where first I met him.
      Years had but cultivated his talents; his visions were bolder and more
      daring than ever; while he had chastened down his hurried and excited tone
      of narrative to a quiet flow of unexaggerated description, which, taking
      his age and appearance into account, it was difficult to discredit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the Frenchmen really gave credit to his revelations, or only from
      politeness affected to do it at first, I cannot say, but assuredly he put
      all their courtesy to a rude test by a little anecdote before he left the
      dinner-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      While speaking of the memorable siege of Valenciennes in '93, at which one
      of the French officers was present and in a high command, Bubbleton at
      once launched forth into some very singular anecdotes of the campaign,
      where, as he alleged, he also had served.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We took an officer of one of your infantry regiments prisoner in a sortie
      one evening,&rdquo; said the Frenchman. &ldquo;I commanded the party, and shall never
      forget the daring intrepidity of his escape. He leaped from the wall into
      the fosse, a height of thirty feet and upwards. <i>Parbleu!</i> we had not
      the heart to fire after him, though we saw that after the shock he crawled
      out upon his hands and feet, and soon afterwards gained strength enough to
      run. He gave me his pocket-book with his name; I shall not forget it
      readily,&mdash;it was Stopford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, poor Billy! He was my junior lieutenant,&rdquo; said Bubbleton; &ldquo;an active
      fellow, but he never could jump with me. Confound him! he has left me a
      souvenir also, though a very different kind from yours,&mdash;a cramp in
      the stomach I shall never get rid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As this seemed a somewhat curious legacy from one brother officer to
      another, we could not help calling on the general for an explanation,&mdash;a
      demand Bubbleton never refused to gratify.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened in this wise,&rdquo; said he, pushing back his chair as he spoke,
      and seating himself with the easy attitude of your true story-teller. &ldquo;The
      night before the assault&mdash;the 24th of July, if my memory serves me
      right&mdash;the sappers were pushing forward the mines with all despatch.
      Three immense globes were in readiness beneath the walls, and some minor
      details were only necessary to complete the preparations. The stormers
      consisted of four British and three German regiments,&mdash;my own, the
      Welsh Fusiliers, being one of the former. We occupied the lines stretching
      from L'Hérault to Damies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The French officer nodded assent, and Bubbleton resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fusiliers were on the right, and divided into two parties,&mdash;an
      assaulting column and a supporting one; the advanced companies at half
      cannon-shot from the walls, the others a little farther off. Thus we were,
      when, about half-past ten, or it might be even eleven o'clock (we were
      drinking some mulled claret in my quarters), a low, swooping kind of a
      noise came stealing along the ground. We listened,&mdash;it grew stronger
      and stronger; and then we could hear musket-shot and shouting, and the
      tramp of men as if running. Out we went; and, by Jove! there we saw the
      first battalion in full retreat towards the camp. It was a sortie in force
      from the garrison, which drove in our advanced posts, and took several
      prisoners. The drums now soon beat to quarters; the men fell in rapidly,
      and we advanced to meet them,&mdash;no pleasant affair, either, let me
      remark, for the night was pitch dark, and we could not even guess the
      strength of your force. It was just then that I was running with all my
      speed to come up with the flank companies, that my cover-sergeant, a cool,
      old Scotch fellow, shouted out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Take care, sir! Stoop there, sir! stoop there!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the advice came too late. I could just discern through the gloom
      something black, hopping and bounding along towards me; now striking the
      ground, and then rebounding again several feet in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Stoop, sir! down!' cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before I could throw myself flat, plump it took me here. Over I went,
      breathless, and deeming all was finished; but, miraculous to say, in a few
      minutes after I found myself coming to, and except the shock, nothing the
      worse for the injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Was that a shell, Sergeant?' said I; 'a spent shell?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Na, sir,' said he, in his own broad way, 'it was naething o' the kind;
      it was only Lieutenant Stopford's head that was snapped aff up there.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His head!&rdquo; exclaimed we all of a breath,&mdash;&ldquo;his head!»
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, poor fellow, so it was; a damned hard kind of a bullet-head, too!
      The blow has left a weakness of the stomach I suppose I shall never
      recover from; and the occurrence being so singular, I have actually never
      asked for a pension,&mdash;there are people, by Jove! would throw
      discredit on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This latter observation seemed so perfectly to sum up our own thoughts on
      the matter that we really had nothing to remark on it; and after a silence
      of a few seconds, politely relieved by the countess hinting at coffee in
      the drawing-room, we arose and followed her.

      CHAPTER XVII. THE RUE DES CAPUCINES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before I parted with Bubbleton that evening be promised to breakfast with
      me on the following morning; and true to his word, entered my quarters
      soon after ten o'clock. I longed to have an opportunity of talking to him
      alone, and learning some intelligence of that country, which, young as I
      had left it, was still hallowed in memory as my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, by Jupiter! this is something like a quarter,&mdash;gilded mouldings,
      frescos, silk hangings, and Persian rugs. I say, Tom, are you sure you
      haven't made a mistake, my boy, and just imagined that you were somebody
      else,&mdash;Murat or Bernadotte, for example? The thing is far easier than
      you may think; it happened to me before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be tranquil on that score,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we are both at home; though these
      quarters are, as you remark, far beyond the mark of a captain of hussars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A captain! Why, hang it, you're not captain already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure. What signifies it? Only think of your own rapid rise
      since we parted; you were but a captain then, and to be now a
      lieutenant-general!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, true, very true,&rdquo; said he, hurriedly, while he bustled about the
      room, examining the furniture, and inspecting the decorations most
      narrowly. &ldquo;Capital service this must be,&rdquo; muttered he, between his teeth;
      &ldquo;not much pay, I fancy, but a deal of plunder and private robbery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say much on that head,&rdquo; said I, laughing outright at what he
      intended for a soliloquy; &ldquo;but I must confess I have no reason to complain
      of my lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad! I should think not,&rdquo; rejoined he; &ldquo;better than Old George's Street.
      Well, well, I wish I were but back there,&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sit down to your breakfast; and perhaps when we talk it over some
      plan may present itself for your exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How thoroughly had I forgotten my friend when I uttered the sentiment; for
      scarcely was he seated at table, when he launched out, as of old, into one
      of his visionary harangues,&mdash;throwing forth dark hints of his own
      political importance, and the keen watch the Emperor had set upon his
      movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend, the thing is impossible,&rdquo; said he, ominously. &ldquo;Nap. knows
      me; he knows my influence with the Tories. To let me escape would be to
      blow all his schemes to the winds. I am destined for the 'Temple,' if not
      for the guillotine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The solemnity of his voice and manner at this moment was too much for me,
      and I laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, you may laugh; so does Anna Maria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is Miss Bubbleton here, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we are both here,&rdquo; ejaculated he, with a deep sigh. &ldquo;Rue Neuve des
      Capucines, No. 46, four flights above the entresol! Ay, and in that
      entresol they have two spies of Fouché's police; I know them well, though
      they pretend to be hairdressers. I'm too much for old Fouché yet; depend
      upon it, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain I endeavored to ascertain what circumstances led him to
      believe himself suspected by the Government; neither was I more fortunate
      in discovering how he first became a <i>détenu</i>. The mist of imaginary
      events, places, and people which he had conjured up around him, prevented
      his ever being able to see his way, or know clearly any one fact connected
      with his present position. Dark hints about spies, suspicious innuendoes
      of concealed enemies, plotting préfets and opened letters, had actually
      filled his brain to the exclusion of everything rational and reasonable,
      and I began seriously to fear for my poor friend's intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoping by a change of topic to induce a more equable tone of thinking, I
      asked about Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right there! they've hanged 'em all,&rdquo; said he. Then, as if suddenly
      remembering himself, he added, with a slight confusion, &ldquo;You were well out
      of that scrape, Tom. Your old friend Barton had a warrant for you the
      morning you left, and there was a reward of five hundred pounds for your
      apprehension; and something, too, for a confounded old piper,&mdash;old
      Blast-the-Bellows, I think they called him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darby! What of him, Bubbleton? they did not take him, I trust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by Jove! They hanged two fellows, each of whom they believed to be
      him, and he was in the crowd looking on, they say. But he's at large
      still; and the report goes, Barton does not stir out at night for fear of
      meeting him, as the fellow has an old score to settle with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, all hopes of liberty would seem extinguished now,&rdquo; said I,
      gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as you may take it, Tom. I'm a bad judge of these things; but I
      fancy that a man who can live here might contrive to eke out life under a
      British Government; though he might yearn now and then for a secret
      police, a cabinet noir, or perhaps a tight cravat in the Temple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, there it is! Now, if we were in Dame Street, we might abuse the
      ministers and the army and the Lord-Lieutenant to our heart's content; and
      if Jemmy O'Brien was n't one of the company, I 'd not mind a hit at Barton
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But does England still maintain her proud tone of ascendency towards
      Ireland? Is the Saxon the hereditary lord, and the Celt the slave, still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There again you puzzle me; for I never saw much of this same ascendency,
      or slavery either. Loyal people, some way or other, were usually in favor
      with the Government, and had what many thought a most unjust proportion of
      the good things to their share. But even the others got off in most cases
      easily too; a devilish deal better than you treated those luckless
      Austrians the other day. You killed some thirty thousand, and made
      bankrupts of the rest of the nation. But then, to be sure, it was the
      cause of liberty you were fighting for. And as for the Italians&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! but you forget these were wars not of our seeking; the treachery of
      false-hearted allies led to these sad results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. But certain it is, nations, like individuals, that have a
      taste for fighting, usually have the good luck to find an adversary; and
      as your Emperor here seems to have learned the Donnybrook Fair trick of
      trailing his coat after him, it would be strange enough if nobody would
      gratify him by standing on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without being able to say why, I felt piqued and annoyed at the tone of
      Bubbleton's remarks, which, coming from one of his narrow intelligence on
      ordinary topics, worried me only the more. I had long since seen that the
      liberty with which in boyhood I was infatuated had no existence save in
      the dreams of ardent patriotism; that the great and the mighty felt
      ambition a goal, and power a birthright; that the watchwords of freedom
      were inscribed on banners when the sentiments had died out of men's
      hearts, while as a passion the more dazzling one of glory made every other
      pale before it; and that the calm head and moderate judgment could scarce
      survive contact with the intoxicating triumphs of a nation's successes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was, indeed, the real change Napoleon had wrought in France. Their
      enthusiasm could not rest content with national liberty; glory alone could
      satisfy a nation drunk with victory. Against the stern followers of the
      Republican era&mdash;the soldiers of the Sambre and Meuse, the men of
      Jemmappes&mdash;he had arrayed the ardent, high-spirited youth of the
      Consulate and the Empire, the heroes of Areola, of Rivoli, of Cairo, and
      Austerlitz. How vain to discuss questions of social order or national
      freedom with the cordoned and glittering bands who saw monarchy and
      kingdoms among the prizes of their ambition! And even I, who had few
      ambitious hopes, how the ardor that once stimulated me and led me to the
      soldier's life,&mdash;how had it given way to the mere conventional
      aspirings of a class! The grade of colonel was far oftener in my thoughts
      than the cause of freedom; the cross of the Legion would have reconciled
      me to much that in my calmer judgment I might deem harsh and tyrannical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Tom,&rdquo; said Bubbleton, who saw in my silence that his
      observations had their weight with me, &ldquo;believe me, my philosophy is the
      true one,&mdash;never to meddle where you cannot serve yourself or some of
      your friends. The world will always consist of two parties,&mdash;one
      governing, the other governed. We belong to the latter category, and shall
      only get into a scrape by poking our heads where they have no business to
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, a few moments since you were full of state secrets, and plots, and
      secret treaties, and Heaven knows what besides!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I was. And for whose interest, man,&mdash;for whose sake?
      George Frederick Augustus Bubbleton's. Ay, no doubt of it. Here am I, a <i>détenu</i>,&mdash;and
      have been these two years and a half&mdash;wasting away existence at
      Verdun, while my property is going to the devil from sheer neglect. My
      West India estates, who can say how I shall find them? my Calcutta
      property, the same; then there's that fee-simple thing in Norfolk. But I
      can't even think of it. Well, I verily believe no single step has been
      taken for my release or exchange. The Whigs, you know, will do nothing for
      me. I may tell you in confidence,&rdquo;&mdash;here he dropped his voice to a
      low whisper,&mdash;&ldquo;I may tell you, Charles Fox hates me. But more of this
      another time. What was I to do in all this mess of trouble and misfortune?
      Stand still and bear it? No, faith; that's not Bubbleton policy. You 'd
      never guess what I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it chanced that some little literary labors of mine&mdash;you know
      I dally sometimes with the muse&mdash;became known to the préfet at
      Verdun. I saw that they watched me; and consequently I made great efforts
      at secrecy, concealing my papers in the chimney, under the floor, sewing
      them in the linings of my coat, and so on. The bait took: they made a
      regular search, seizing my manuscripts, put great seals on all the
      packages, and sent them up to Paris. The day after, I made submission,&mdash;offered
      to reveal all to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. And accordingly they
      sent me up here with an escort. What would have come next I cannot tell
      you, if Anna Maria had not found out Lord Lauderdale, and trumped up some
      story to him, so that he interfered. And we are now living at the Rue
      Neuve des Capucines; but how long we shall be there, and where they may
      send us next, I wish I could only guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes' consideration satisfied me that the police were concerned
      in Bubbleton's movements, and, knowing at once that no danger was to be
      apprehended from such a source, were merely holding him up for some
      occasion when they could make use of him to found some charge against the
      British Government,&mdash;a manoeuvre constantly employed, and always
      successful with the Parisians, wherever an explanation became necessary in
      the public papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have served no purpose to impart these suspicions of mine to
      Bubbleton himself; on the contrary, he would inevitably have destroyed all
      clew to their confirmation by some false move, had I done so. With this
      impression, then, I resolved to wait patiently, watch events, and when the
      time came, see what best could be done towards effecting his liberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was disposed to place more reliance on Miss Bubbleton's statements
      than those of her imaginative brother, I agreed to his proposal to pay her
      a visit; and accordingly we set out together for the Rue Neuve des
      Capucines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant-General Bubbleton's quarters were by no means of that imposing
      character which befitted his rank in the British army. Traversing a dirty
      courtyard strewed with firewood, we entered a little gloomy passage, from
      which a still gloomier stair ascended to the topmost regions of the house,
      where, unlocking a door, he pushed me before him into a small,
      meanly-furnished apartment, the centre of which was occupied by a little
      iron stove, whose funnel pierced the ceiling above, and gave the chamber
      somewhat the air of a ship's cabin. Bubbleton, however, either did not or
      would not perceive any want of comfort or propriety in the whole; on the
      contrary, he strode the floor with the step of an emperor, and placed the
      chair for me to sit on as though he were about to seat me on a throne.
      While exchanging his coat for a most ragged dressing-gown, he threw
      himself on an old sofa with such energy of ease that the venerable article
      of furniture creaked and groaned in every joint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's out,&rdquo; said he, with a toss of his thumb to a half-open door; &ldquo;gone
      to take a stroll in the Tuileries for half an hour, so that we shall have
      a little chat before she comes. And now, what will ye take? A little
      sherry and water? a glass of maraschino, eh? or what say you to a nip of
      real Nantz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my dear friend; you forget the hour, not to speak of my French
      education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very true,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When I was in the Forty-fifth&mdash;&rdquo; When he
      had uttered these words, he stopped suddenly, hesitated, and stammered,
      and at last, fairly overcome with confusion, he unfolded a huge
      pocket-handkerchief, and blew his nose with the sound of a cavalry
      trumpet, while he resumed: &ldquo;We had a habit in the old Forty-fifth&mdash;a
      deuced bad one, I confess&mdash;of a mess breakfast, that began after
      parade and always ran into luncheon&mdash;But hush! here she comes,&rdquo; cried
      he, in evident delight at the interruption so opportunely arriving. Then,
      springing up, he threw open the door, and called out, &ldquo;I say, Anna Maria,
      you 'll not guess who's here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Either the ascent of the steep stair called for all the lady's spare
      lungs, or the question had little interest for her, as she certainly made
      no reply whatever, but continued to mount, step by step, with that
      plodding, monosyllabic pace one falls into at the highest of six flights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried he aloud, &ldquo;no, you're wrong; it is not Lauderdale.&rdquo; Then,
      turning towards me, with a finger to his nose, he added, with pantomimic
      action, &ldquo;She thinks you are Yarmouth. Wrong again, by Jove! What do you
      say to Tom Burke,&mdash;Burke of 'Ours.' as I used to call him long ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Miss Bubbleton had reached the door, and was holding the
      handle to recover her breath after the fatigue of the ascent. Even in that
      momentary glance, however, I recognized her. Nothing altered by time, she
      was the same crabbed, crossgrained-looking personage I remembered years
      before. She carried a little basket on her arm, of which her brother
      hastened to relieve her, and showed no little concern to remove out of
      sight. Being divested of this, she held out her hand, and saluted me with
      more cordiality than I looked for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had our greetings been exchanged, when Bubbleton broke in, &ldquo;I 've
      told him everything, Anna Maria. He knows the whole affair; no use in
      boring him with any more. I say, isn't he grown prodigiously? And a
      captain already,&mdash;just think of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, sir, you've heard of the sad predicament his folly has brought us
      into?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, Anna Maria!&rdquo; cried Bubbleton; &ldquo;no nonsense, old girl. Burke
      will put all to rights; he's aide-de-camp to Murat, and dines with him
      every day,&mdash;eh, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if he be?&rdquo; interrupted the lady, without permitting me time to
      disclaim the honor. &ldquo;How can he ever&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, it's all arranged between us; and don't make a fuss about
      nothing. You 'll only make bad worse, as you always do. Come, Tom; the
      secret is, I shall be ruined if I don't get back to England soon. Heaven
      knows who receives my dividends all this time. Then that confounded tin
      mine! they 've mismanaged the thing so much I haven't received five
      hundred pounds from Cornwall since this time twelve months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you haven't,&rdquo; said the lady, as with clasped hands and eyes fixed
      she sat staring at the little stove with the stern stoicism of a martyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows that,&rdquo; said Bubbleton, with a nod, as if grateful for even so
      much testimony in his favor. &ldquo;And as for that scoundrel, Thistlethwait,
      the West India agent, I've a notion he's broke; not a shilling from him
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not sixpence,&rdquo; echoed the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear that,&rdquo; cried he, overjoyed at the concurrence. &ldquo;And the fact is,&mdash;you
      will smile when I tell you, but upon my honor it's true,&mdash;I am
      actually hard up for cash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea tickled him so much, and seemed so ludicrous withal, that he fell
      back on the sofa, and laughed till the tears ran down his face. Not so
      Miss Bubbleton: her grim face grew more fixed, every feature hardened as
      if becoming stone, while gradually a sneer curled her thin lip; but she
      never spoke a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not speak of the annoyance of being out of England, nor the loss of
      influence a man sustains after a long absence,&rdquo; said Bubbleton, as he
      paced the room with his hands deep thrust in his dressing-gown pockets.
      &ldquo;These are things one can feel; and as for me, they weigh more on my mind
      than mere money considerations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, General,&rdquo; said I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General!&rdquo; echoed the lady with a start round, and holding up both her
      hands,&mdash;&ldquo;General! You have n't been such a fool,&mdash;it's not
      possible you could be such a fool&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please to be quiet, old damsel?&rdquo; said Bubbleton, with more of
      harshness than he had yet used in his manner. &ldquo;Can you persuade yourself
      to mind your own household concerns, and leave George Frederick Augustus
      Bubbleton to manage his own matters as he deems best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he turned short round towards me, and throwing up his eyebrows to
      their full height, he touched his forehead knowingly with the tip of his
      forefinger, and uttered the words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand! Poor thing!&rdquo; concluding the pantomime with a deep sigh
      from the bottom of his chest, while he added something in a low whisper
      about &ldquo;a fall from an elephant when she was a child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burke, will you listen to me?&rdquo; said the lady, with an energy of voice
      and manner there was no gainsaying&mdash;&ldquo;listen to me for five minutes;
      and probably, short as the time is, I may be able to put you in possession
      of a few plain facts concerning our position, and if you have the
      inclination and the power to serve us, you may then know how best it can
      be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bubbleton made me a sign to gratify her desire of loquaciousness, while
      with a most expressive shrug he intimated that I should probably hear a
      very incoherent statement. This done, he lighted his meerschaum, wrapped
      his ragged <i>robe de chambre</i> around him, and lay down full length on
      the sofa, with the air of a man who had fortified himself to undergo any
      sacrifices that might be demanded at his hands; taking care the while to
      assume his position in such a manner that he could exchange glances with
      me without his being observed by his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came over, Mr. Burke, only a few months before the war broke out, and
      like the rest of our countrymen and women were made <i>détenus</i>. This
      was bad enough; but my wise brother made it far worse, for instead of
      giving his name, with his real rank and position, he would call himself a
      lieutenant-general, affect to have immense wealth and great political
      influence. The consequence was, when others were exchanged and sent home,
      his name not being discoverable in any English list, was passed over;
      while his assumed fortune involved us in every expense and extravagance,
      and his mock importance made us the object of the secret police, who never
      ceased to watch and spy after us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital! excellent! by Jove!&rdquo; cried Bubbleton, as he rolled forth a long
      curl of blue smoke from the angle of his mouth; &ldquo;she 's admirable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have told you before,&rdquo; said the lady, not paying the least
      attention to his interruption, &ldquo;that he was obliged to sell out of the
      Forty-fifth; a certain Mr. Montague Crofts, whom you may remember, having
      won every shilling he possessed, even to the sale of his commission. This
      was the cause of our coming abroad; so that at the very moment that he was
      giving himself these airs of pretended greatness, we were ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my life, she believes all that,&rdquo; whispered Bubbleton, with a wink at
      me. &ldquo;Poor old thing! I must get Larrey to look at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happily, or unhappily&mdash;who shall say which?&mdash;there was a
      greater fool even than himself in the village; and he was the <i>maire</i>.
      This wise functionary became alarmed at the piles of papers and rolls of
      manuscripts that were seen about our rooms, and equally suspicious about
      the dark hints and mysterious innuendoes he threw out from time to time.
      The préfet was informed of it; and the result was, an order for our
      removal to Paris. Here, then, we are; with what destiny before us who
      shall tell? For, as he still persists in his atrocious nonsense, and calls
      himself major-general&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lieutenant-general, my dear,&rdquo; said Bubbleton, mildly; &ldquo;I never was
      major-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not too bad?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Could any patience endure this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be violent; take care, Anna Maria,&rdquo; said he, rebukingly. &ldquo;Potts
      said I should use restraint again, if you showed any return of the
      paroxysm. That's the way she takes it,&rdquo; said he in a low whisper, &ldquo;with a
      blinking about the eyes and a pattering of the feet. Bathe your temples,
      dear, and you'll be better presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna Maria sat still, not uttering a word, and actually fearing by a
      gesture to encourage a commentary on her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes she 'll mope for hours,&rdquo; muttered he in my ear; &ldquo;at others,
      she's furious,&mdash;there's no saying how it will turn. You wouldn't like
      a pipe? I forgot to ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And worse than all, sir,&rdquo; said the lady, as if no longer able to restrain
      her temper, &ldquo;he is supposed to be a spy of the police. I heard it myself
      this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what!&rdquo; exclaimed Bubbleton, jumping up in an ecstasy of delight. &ldquo;A
      spy! By Jove! I knew it. Lord! what fellows they are, these French! not
      two days here yet, and they discovered I was no common man,&mdash;eh,
      Burke? Maybe I haven't frightened them, my boy. It's not every one would
      create such a sensation, let me tell you; I knew I'd do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bubbleton looked at him for an instant with a sneer of the most
      withering contempt, and then rising abruptly, left the room. But the
      general little cared for such evidences of her censure; he danced about
      the room, snapping his fingers, and chuckling with self-satisfaction, the
      thought of being believed to be a police spy giving him the most intense
      and heartfelt pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has moments, Tom, when she's downright clear; you 'd not think it,
      but sometimes she's actually shrewd. You saw how she hit upon that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that her brother was favored with some of these lucid intervals!&rdquo;
       was the thought that ran through my head at the moment; for I knew better
      than he did how needful a clearer brain and sharper faculties than his
      would be to escape the snares his folly and vanity were spreading around
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we make a morning call at our friend the countess's, Tom?&rdquo; said
      Bubbleton. &ldquo;She told me she received every day about this hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt nowise disposed for the visit; and so, having engaged my friend to
      dine with me at the Luxembourg the next day, we parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sauntered homewards, I was surprised how difficult I found it to
      disabuse my mind of the absurd insinuations Bubbleton had thrown out
      against his sister's sanity; for, though well knowing his fondness for
      romance, and his taste for embellishment on every occasion, I. yet could
      not get rid of the impression that her oddity of manner might only be
      another feature of eccentricity, just as extravagant, but differing in its
      tendencies, as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      To assist him whose kindness to myself of old I never ceased to remember
      with gratitude, was my firm resolve; but to ascertain his exact position
      was all-essential for this purpose, and I could not help saying, half
      aloud, &ldquo;If I had but Duchesne here now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak of the devil, <i>mon ami!</i>&rdquo; said he, drawing his arm within
      mine, while I was scarcely able to avoid a cry of astonishment. &ldquo;Where do
      you dine to-day, Burke?&rdquo; said he, in his quiet, easy tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where did you come from, Duchesne? Are you long here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer my question first. Can you dine with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure; with pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then meet me at the corner of the Rue des Trois Têtes, at six o'clock,
      and I 'll be your guide afterwards. This is <i>my</i> way now. <i>Au
      revoir</i>.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII. THE MOISSON d'OR
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I arrived at the rendezvous, I found Duchesne already awaiting me
      with a carriage, into which we stepped, and drove rapidly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of your word, Burke; and, what is scarcely less valuable in the
      times we live in, a man of prudence too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As how the latter, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not come in uniform, which is all the better where we are going;
      besides, it gives me the hope of presenting you to my respected aunt, the
      Duchesse de Montserrât, who will take your black coat as a compliment to
      the whole Bourbon dynasty. You must come with me there, if it only be for
      half an hour. And now tell me, have you ever dined at the 'Moisson d'Or'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never; not even heard of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you shall to-day. And meanwhile I may tell you, that although
      in a remote and little-visited quarter of Paris, it stands unrivalled for
      the excellence of its fare and the rare delicacy of its wines,&mdash;a
      reputation not of yesterday, but of some years' standing. Nor is that the
      only thing remarkable about it, as I shall explain hereafter. But come!
      How are your friends at the Hôtel Clichy? and how fares your suit with
      mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My suit? It never was such. You know, to the full as well as I do, my
      pretensions aspired not half so high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better, and so much the worse. I mean the former for me, as I
      hate to have a friend for a rival; the latter for you, who ought to have
      learned by this time that a handsome girl and a million of francs are more
      easily won than a cross of the Legion or a colonel's epaulette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you serious, Duchesne? Have you really intentions in that
      quarter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Morbleu!</i> to be sure I have. It is for that I am here in Paris in
      the dog days; travelled one hundred and twenty leagues; ay, and more, too,&mdash;have
      brought with me my most aristocratic aunt, who never remembers in her life
      to have seen full-grown leaves in the Tuileries gardens. I knew what an
      ally she would be in the negotiation; and so I managed, through some
      friends in the bureau of the minister, to give her a rare fright about an
      estate of hers, which by some accident escaped confiscation in the
      Revolution, and which nothing but the greatest efforts on her part could
      now rescue from the fangs of the crown. You may be sure she is not
      particularly in love with the present Government on this score; but the
      trick secures her speaking more guardedly than she has the habit of doing,
      besides inducing her to make acquaintances nothing but such a threat would
      accomplish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intend, then, she should know Madame de Lacostellerie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I have already persuaded her that the Hôtel Clichy is the
      pivot of all Paris, and that nothing but consummate tact and management on
      her part will succeed there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I scarcely thought you cared for mademoiselle; and never dreamed of
      your proposing to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, till about a week ago. However, my plans require money, and would
      not be encumbered by my having a wife. I see nothing better at the moment,
      and so my mind is soon made up. But here we are; this is our
      resting-place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Moisson d'Or,&rdquo; although not known to me, was then the most celebrated
      place for dining in Paris. The habits of the house&mdash;for there was no
      <i>table d'hôte</i>&mdash;required that everything should be ordered
      beforehand, and the parties all dined separately. The expensive habits and
      extravagant prices secured its frequenters from meeting the class who
      usually dined at restaurants; and this gave it a vogue among the wealthy
      and titled, whose equipages now thronged the street, and filled the <i>porte
      cochère</i>. I had but time to recognize the face of one of the marshals
      and a minister of state, as we pushed our way through the court, and
      entered a small pavilion beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll join you in an instant,&rdquo; said Duchesne, as he left the room hastily
      after the waiter. In a couple of minutes he was back again. &ldquo;Come along;
      it's all right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I wish to show you a corner of the old house
      that only the privileged ever see, and we are fortunate in finding it
      unoccupied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We recrossed the court, and mounted a large oak stair to a corridor, which
      conducted us, by three sides of a quadrangle, to a smaller stair, nearly
      perpendicular. At the top of this, a strong door, barred and padlocked,
      stood, which, being opened, led into a large and lofty <i>salon</i>,
      opening by three spacious windows on a terrace that formed the roof of the
      building. Some citron and orange trees were disposed tastefully along
      this, and filled the room with their fragrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Antoine; let us be served here,&rdquo; said Duchesne to the waiter; &ldquo;I
      have already given orders about the dinner. And now, Burke, come out here.
      What think you of that view?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had I set foot on the terrace, when I started back in mingled
      admiration and amazement. Beneath us lay the great city, in the mellow
      light of an evening in September. Close&mdash;so close as actually to
      startle&mdash;was the large dome of the Invalides shining like a ball of
      molten gold, the great courtyard in front dotted with figures; beyond,
      again, was the Seine, the surface flashing and flickering in the sunlight,&mdash;I
      traced it along to the Pont Neuf; and then my eye rested on Notre-Dame,
      whose tall, dark towers stood out against the pinkish sky, while the
      deep-toned bell boomed through the still air. I turned towards the
      Tuileries, and could see the guard of honor in waiting for the Emperor's
      appearing. In the gardens, hundreds were passing and repassing, or
      standing around the band which played in front of the pavilion. A tide of
      population poured across the bridges and down the streets, along which
      equipages and horsemen dashed impetuously onward. There was all the life
      and stir of a mighty city, its sounds dulled by distance, but blended into
      one hoarse din, like the far-off sea at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know, Burke, that this was a favorite resort of the courtiers
      of the last reign. The gay young Gardes du Corps, the gallant youths of
      the royal household, constantly dined here. The terrace we now stand on
      once held a party who came at the invitation of no less a personage than
      him whom men call Louis the Eighteenth. It was a freak of the time to
      pronounce the Court dinners execrable: and they even go so far as to say
      that Marie Antoinette herself once planned a party here; but this I cannot
      vouch for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Duchesne was interrupted by the entrance of the waiters who
      came to serve the dinner. I had not a moment left to admire the beauty and
      richness of the antique silver dishes which covered the table, when a
      gentle tap at the door attracted my attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Jacotot himself!&rdquo; said Duchesne, as, rising hastily, he advanced to
      meet the new arrival. He was a tall, thin old man, much stooped by years,
      but with an air and carriage distinctly well bred; his white hair, brushed
      rigidly back, fastened into a queue behind, and his lace &ldquo;jabot&rdquo; and
      ruffles, bespoke him as the remnant of a date long past. His coat was
      blue, of a shade somewhat lighter than is usually worn. He also wore large
      buckles in his shoes, whose brilliancy left no doubt of their real value.
      Bowing with great ceremony, he advanced slowly into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are come to dine with us,&mdash;is it not so, Jacotot?&rdquo; said
      Duchesne, as he still held his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, my dear chevalier; the Comte de Chambord and Edouard de
      Courcelles are below,&mdash;I have promised to join them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is Courcelles here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, with a timid glance towards where I sat, and a
      look as if imploring caution and reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fear nothing. And that reminds me I have not presented my friend and
      brother officer: Captain Burke,&mdash;Monsieur Jacotot. You may feel
      assured, Jacotot, I make no mistake in the friends I introduce here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man gave a smile of pleasure; while, turning to me, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is discretion itself; and I am but too happy to make your
      acquaintance. And now, Chevalier, one word with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He retreated towards the door, holding Duchesne's arm, and whispering as
      he went. Duchesne's face, however, expressed his impatience as he spoke;
      and at last he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, my worthy friend; I always submit to your wiser counsels.
      So farewell for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked after the old man as he slowly descended the stairs, and then
      closing the door and locking it, he exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i>I found it very hard to listen to his prosing with even a
      show of patience, and was half tempted to tell him that the Bourbons could
      wait, though the soup could not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Monsieur Jacotot is a Royalist, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that he is; and so are all they who frequent this house. Don't start;
      the police know it well, and no one is more amused at their absurd
      plottings and conspirings than Fouché himself. Now and then, to be sure,
      some fool, more rash and brainless than the others, will come up from La
      Vendée and try to knock his head against the walls of the Temple,&mdash;like
      De Courcelles there, who has no other business in Paris except to be
      guillotined, if it were worth the trouble. Then the minister affects to
      stir himself and be on the alert, just to terrify them; but he well knows
      that danger lurks not in this quarter. Believe me, Burke, the present
      rulers of France have no greater security than in the contemptible
      character of all their opponents. There is no course for a man of energy
      and courage to adopt. But I ask your pardon, my dear friend, for this
      treasonable talk. What think you of the dinner? The Royalists would never
      have fallen if they had understood government as well as cuisine. Taste
      that <i>suprême</i>, and say if you don't regret the Capets,&mdash;a
      feeling you can indulge the more freely because you never knew them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot comprehend, Duchesne, what are the grievances you charge against
      the present Government of France. Had you been an old courtier of the last
      reign,&mdash;a hanger-on of Versailles or the Tuileries,&mdash;the thing
      were intelligible; but you, a soldier, a man of daring and enterprise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me interrupt you. I am so only because it is the taste of the day;
      but I despise the parade of military glory we have got into the habit of.
      I prefer the period when a <i>mot</i> did as much and more than a
      discharge of <i>mitraille</i>, and men's <i>esprit</i> and talent
      succeeded better than a strong sword-arm or a seat on horseback. There
      were gentlemen in France once, my dear Burke. Ay, <i>parbleu!</i> and
      ladies too,&mdash;not marchionesses of the drum-head nor countesses of the
      bivouac, but women in whom birth heightened beauty, whose loveliness had
      the added charm of high descent beaming from their bright eyes and sitting
      throned on their lofty brows; before whom our mustached marshals had stood
      trembling and ashamed,&mdash;these men who lounge so much at ease in the
      <i>salons</i> of the Tuileries! Let me help you to this <i>salmi</i>; it
      is <i>à la Louis Quinze</i>, and worthy of the Regency itself. Well, then,
      a glass of Burgundy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend Monsieur Jacotot seems somewhat of an original,&rdquo; said I, half
      desirous to change a topic which I always felt an unpleasant one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not wrong; he is so. Jacotot is a thorough Frenchman; at least,
      he has had the fortune to mix up in his destiny those extremes of elevated
      sentiment and absurdity which go very far to compose the life of my good
      countrymen. I must tell you a short anecdote&mdash;But shall we adjourn to
      the terrace? for, to prevent the interruption of servants, I have ordered
      our dessert there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a most agreeable proposal; and so, having seated ourselves in a
      little arbor of orange-shrubs, with a view of the river and the Palace
      gardens beneath us, Duchesne thus began:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going somewhat far back in history; but have no fears on that head,
      Burke,&mdash;my story is a very brief one. There was, once upon a time, in
      France, a monarch of some repute, called Louis the Fourteenth; a man, if
      fame be not unjust, who possessed the most kingly qualities of which we
      have any record in books. He was brave, munificent, high-minded, ardent,
      selfish, cruel, and ungrateful, beyond any other man in his own dominions;
      and, like people with such gifts, he had the good fortune to attach men to
      him just as firmly and devotedly as though he was not in his heart devoid
      of every principle of friendship and affection. I need not tell you what
      the ladies of his reign thought of him; my present business is with the
      ruder sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the courtiers of the day was a certain Vicomte Arnoud de Gency, a
      young man who, at the age of eighteen, won his grade of colonel at the
      siege of Besançon by an act of coolness and courage worthy recording. He
      deliberately advanced into one of the breaches, and made a sketch of the
      interior works of the fortification while the enemy's shot was tearing up
      the ground around him. When the deed was reported to the king, he
      interrupted the relation, saying, 'Don't tell me who did this, for I have
      made De Gency a colonel for it;' so rapidly did Louis guess the author of
      so daring a feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From that hour, the young colonel's fortune was made. He was appointed
      one of the gentlemen of the chamber to his Majesty, and distinguished by
      almost daily marks of royal intimacy. His qualities eminently fitted him
      for the tone of the society he lived in; he was a most witty converser, a
      good musician, and had, moreover, a very handsome person,&mdash;gifts not
      undervalued at Saint-Germain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such were his social qualities; and so thoroughly did he understand the
      king's humor, that even La Vallière herself saw the necessity of retaining
      him at the Court, and, in fact, made a confidant of him on several
      occasions of difficulty. Still, with all these favors of fortune, when the
      object of envy to almost all the rest of the household, Arnoud de Gency
      was suffering in his heart one of the most trying afflictions that can
      befall a proud man so placed; he was in actual poverty,&mdash;in want so
      pressing that all the efforts he could make, all the contrivances he could
      practise, were barely sufficient to prevent his misery being public. The
      taste for splendor in dress and equipage which characterized the period
      had greatly injured his private fortune, while the habit of high play,
      which Louis encouraged and liked to see about him, completed his ruin. The
      salary of his appointments was merely enough to maintain his daily
      expenditure; and thus was he, with a breaking heart, obliged not only to
      mix in all the reckless gayety and frivolity of that voluptuous Court,
      but, still more, tax his talents and his energies for new themes of
      pleasure, fresh sources of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worn out at length by the long struggle between his secret sorrow and his
      pride, he resolved to appeal to the king, and in a few words tell his
      Majesty the straits to which he was reduced, and implore his protection.
      To this he was impelled not solely on his own account, but on that also of
      his only child, a boy of eight or nine years old, whose mother died in
      giving him birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An occasion soon presented itself. The king had given orders for a
      hunting-party at St. Cloud; and at an early hour of the morning De Gency
      in his hunting-dress took up his position in one of the ante-chambers
      through which the king must pass: not alone, however; at his side there
      stood a lovely boy, also dressed in the costume of the chase. He wore a
      velvet doublet of green, slashed with gold, and ornamented by a broad
      belt, from which hung his <i>couteau de chasse</i>; even to the falcon
      feather in his cap, nothing was forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had not waited long when the folding-doors were thrown wide, and a
      moment after Louis appeared, accompanied by a single attendant, the
      Marquis de Verneuil, unhappily one of the very few enemies Arnoud
      possessed in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah, De Gency! you here?' said the king, gayly. 'They told me &ldquo;brelan&rdquo;
       had been unfavorable lately, and that we should not see you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It is true, Sire,' said he, with a sad effort at a smile; 'it is only on
      your Majesty fortune always smiles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>Pardieu!</i> you must not say so; I lost a rouleau last night. But
      whom have we here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My son; so please you, Sire, my only son, who desires, at an earlier age
      than even his father did, to serve your Majesty.'
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;'How like his mother!' said the king, pushing back the fair ringlets from
      the boy's forehead, and gazing almost fondly on his handsome features,&mdash;'how
      like her! She was a Courcelles?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'She was, Sire,' said Arnoud, as the tears fell on his cheek and coursed
      slowly along his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And you want something for him?' said the king, resuming his wonted
      tone, while he busied himself with his sword-knot; 'is it not so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If I might dare to ask&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Assuredly you may. The thing is, what can we do? Eh, Verneuil, what say
      you? He is but an infant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'True, Sire,' replied the marquis, with a look of respect, in which the
      most subtle could not discover a trait of his sarcastic nature; 'but there
      is a place vacant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah, indeed,' said the king, quickly. 'What is it? He shall have it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Monsieur Jacotot, your Majesty's head cook, stands in need of a
      turnspit,' said he, in a low whisper, only audible to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A turnspit!' said the king. And scarcely was the word uttered when, as
      if the irony was his own, he burst into a most immoderate fit of laughter,&mdash;an
      emotion that seemed to increase as he endeavored to repress it; when at
      the instant the <i>cor de chasse</i>, then heard without, gave a new turn
      to his thoughts, and he hurried forward with De Yerneuil, leaving De Gency
      and his son rooted to the spot,&mdash;indignant passion in that heart
      which despair and sorrow had almost rendered callous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Majesty was still laughing as he mounted his barb in the courtyard;
      and the courtiers, like well-bred gentlemen, laughed as became them, with
      that low, quiet laugh which is the meet chorus of a sovereign's mirth,
      when suddenly two loud reports, so rapidly following on each other as
      almost to seem one, startled the glittering cortege, and even made the
      Arab courser of the king plunge madly in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>Par Saint Denis!</i>Messieurs,' said Louis, passionately, 'this
      pleasantry of yours is ill thought of. Who has dared to do this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But none spoke. A terrified look around the circle was the only reply to
      the king's question, when a page rushed forward, his dress spotted and
      blood-stained, his face pale with horror,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Your Majesty,&mdash;ah, Sire!' said he, kneeling. But sobs choked him,
      and he could not utter more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What is this? Will no one tell?' cried the king, as a frown of dark omen
      shadowed his angry features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Your Majesty has lost a brave, an honest, and a faithful follower,
      Sire,' said Monsieur de Coulanges. 'Arnoud de Gency is no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, I saw him this instant,' said the king. 'He asked me some favor for
      his boy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'True, Sire,' replied De Coulanges, mournfully. But he checked himself in
      time, for already the well-known and dreaded expression of passion had
      mounted to the king's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dismiss the <i>chasse</i>, gentlemen,' said he, in a low thick voice.
      'And do you, Monsieur de Verneuil, attend me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cortege was soon scattered; and the Marquis de Verneuil followed the
      king with an expression where fear and dread were not to be mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Verneuil did indeed seem an altered man when he appeared
      among his friends that evening. Whatever the king had said to him
      assuredly had worked its due effect; for all his raillery was gone, and
      even the veriest trifler of the party might have dared an encounter with
      wits which then were subdued and broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next morning, however, the sun shone out brilliantly. The king was in
      high spirits; the game abounded; and his Majesty with his own hand brought
      down eight pheasants. The Marquis de Verneuil could hit nothing; for
      although the best marksman of the day, his hand shook and his sight failed
      him, and the king won fifty louis from him before they reached
      Saint-Germain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never was there a happier day nor followed by a pleasanter evening. The
      king supped in Madame de la Vallière's apartment; the private band played
      the most delicious airs during the repast; and when at length the party
      retired to rest, not one bright dream was clouded by the memory of Arnoud
      de Gency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, now, were I merely recounting an anecdote, I should stop,&rdquo; said the
      chevalier; &ldquo;but must continue a little longer, though all the romance of
      my story is over. The Marquis de Verneuil was a good hater: even poor De
      Gency's fate did not move him, and he actually did do what he had only
      threatened in mockery,&mdash;he sent the orphan child to be a turnspit in
      the royal kitchen. Of course he changed his name,&mdash;the title of an
      old and honored family would soon have betrayed the foul deed,&mdash;and
      the boy was called Jacotot, after the <i>chef</i> himself. The king
      inquired no further on the subject; Arnoud's name recalled too unpleasant
      a topic for the lips of a courtier ever to mention; and the whole
      circumstance was soon entirely forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This same Jacotot was the grandfather of my old friend, whom you saw a
      few minutes since. Fate, that seems to jest with men's destinies, made
      them as successful at the fire of the kitchen as ever their ancestors were
      at that of a battery; and Monsieur Jacotot, our present host, has not his
      equal in Paris. Here for years the younger members of the royal family
      used to sup; this room was their favorite apartment; and one evening, when
      at a later sitting than usual the ruler of the feast was carried beyond
      himself in the praise of an admirable plat, he sent for Jacotot, and told
      him, whatever favor he should ask, he himself would seek for him at the
      hands of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was the long-wished-for moment of the poor fellow's life. He drew
      from his bosom the title-deeds of his ancient name and fortune, and placed
      them in the prince's hand without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What! and are you a De Gency?' said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Alas! I shame to say it, I am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come, gentlemen,' said the gay young prince, 'a bumper to our worthy
      friend, whom, with God's blessing, I shall see restored right soon to his
      fitting rank and station. Yes, De Gency! my word upon it, the next evening
      I sup here I shall bring with me his Majesty's own signature to these
      title-deeds. Make place, gentlemen, and let him sit down!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But poor Jacotot was too much excited by his feelings of joy and
      gratitude, and he rushed from the room in a torrent of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evening the prince spoke of never came. Soon after that commenced the
      troubles to the royal family; the dreadful events of Versailles; the
      flight to Varennes; the 10th August,&mdash;a horrible catalogue I cannot
      bear to trace. There, yonder, where now the groups are loitering, or
      sitting around in happy knots, there died Louis the Sixteenth. The prince
      I spoke of is an exile: they call him Louis the Eighteenth; but he is a
      king without a kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Jacotot lives on in hope. He has waded through all the terrors of the
      Revolution; he has seen the guillotine erected almost before his door and
      beheld his former friends led one by one to the slaughter. Twice was he
      himself brought forth, and twice was his life spared by some admirer of
      his cuisine. But perhaps all his trials were inferior to the heart-burning
      with which he saw the places once occupied by the blood of Saint Louis now
      occupied by the <i>canaille</i> of the Revolution. Marat and Robespierre
      frequented his house; and Barras seldom passed a week without dining
      there. This, I verily believe, was a heavier affliction than any of his
      personal sufferings; and I have often heard him recount, with no feigned
      horror, the scenes which took place among the <i>incroyables</i>, as they
      called themselves, whose orgies he contrasted so unfavorably with the more
      polished excesses of his regal visitors. Through all the anarchy of that
      fearful period; through the scarce less sanguinary time of the Directory;
      through the long, dreary oppression of the consulate; and now, in the more
      grinding tyranny of the Empire, he hopes, ay, still hopes on, that the day
      will come when from the hands of the king himself he shall receive his
      long-buried rank, and stand forth a De Gency. Poor fellow! there is
      something noble and manly in the long struggle with fortune,&mdash;in that
      long-sustained contest in which he would never admit defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such are the followers of the Bourbons: their best traits, their highest
      daring, their most long-suffering endurance, only elicited in the pursuit
      of some paltry object of personal ambition. They have tasted the cup of
      adversity, ay, drained it to the very dregs; they have seen carnage and
      bloodshed such as no war ever surpassed: and all they have learned by
      experience is, to wish for the long past days of royal tyranny and
      frivolity back again; to see a glittering swarm of debauchees fluttering
      around a sensualist king; and to watch the famished faces of the
      multitude, without a thought that the tiger is only waiting for his
      spring. As to a thought of true liberty, one single high and noble
      aspiration after freedom, they never dreamed of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my friend, I have no desire to win you over to the Bourbon
      cause; neither, if I could, would I make you a Jacobin. But how is this?
      Can it really be so late? Come, we have no time to lose: it is not
      accounted good breeding to be late in a visit at the Faubourg.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. THE TWO SOIREES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Duchesne's story had unfortunately driven all memory of Bubbleton out of
      my head; and it was only as we entered the street where the Duchesse de
      Montserrat lived that I remembered my friend, and thought of asking the
      chevalier's advice about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few words I explained so much of his character and situation as was
      necessary, and was going on to express my fears lest a temperament so
      unstable and uncertain should involve its possessor in much trouble, when
      Duchesne interrupted me by saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be of courage on that head. Your friend, if the man you describe him, is
      the very person to baffle the police. They can see to any depth, if the
      water be only clear; muddy it, and it matters little how shallow it be.
      This Bubbleton might be of the greatest service just now; you must present
      me to him, Burke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most willingly. But first promise that you will not involve my poor
      friend in the snares of any plot. Heaven knows, his own faculties are
      quite sufficient for his mystification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plot! snares!&mdash;why, what are you thinking of? But come, this is our
      halting-place; and here we are, without my even having a moment to give
      you any account of my good aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he turned the handle of a large door, which led into a gloomy
      <i>porte cochère</i>, dimly illuminated by a single old-fashioned lantern.
      A fat, unwieldy-looking porter peeped at us from his den in the
      conciergerie; and then, having announced our approach by ringing a bell,
      he closed the shutter, and left us to find the way ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascending the great spacious stair, the wall alongside which was covered
      with family portraits,&mdash;grim-looking heroes in mail, or prim dames
      with bouquets in their jewelled hands,&mdash;we reached a species of
      gallery, from which several doors led off. Here a servant, dressed in deep
      black, was standing to announce the visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the servant preceded us along the corridor, I could not help feeling
      the contrast of this gloomy mansion, where every footstep had its own sad
      echo, with the gorgeous splendor of the Hôtel Clichy. Here, all was dark,
      cold, and dreary; there, everything was lightsome, cheerful, and elegant.
      What an emblem, to my thinking, were they both of the dynasties they
      represented! But the reflection was only made as one half of the
      folding-door was thrown open,&mdash;the double-door was the prerogative of
      the blood-royal,&mdash;and we were announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apartment&mdash;a large, sombre-looking one&mdash;was empty, however,
      and we traversed this, and a second similar to it, our names being
      repeated as before; when at length the low tones of voices indicated our
      approach to the <i>salon</i> where the visitors were assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimly lighted by a few lamps, far apart from each other, the apartment as
      we entered seemed even larger than it really was. At one end, around a
      huge antique fireplace, sat a group of ladies, whom in a glance I
      recognized as of the class so distinctively called dowager. They were
      seated in deep-cushioned fauteuils, and were mostly employed in some
      embroidery work, which they laid down each time they spoke; and resumed,
      less to prosecute the labor, than, as it were, from mere habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all the insinuating gracefulness of a well-bred Frenchman, Duchesne
      approached the seat next the chimney, and respectfully kissed the hand
      extended towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me, my dear aunt, to present a very intimate friend,&mdash;Captain
      Burke,&rdquo; said he, as he led me forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of the word &ldquo;captain,&rdquo; I could perceive that every hand
      dropped its embroidery-frame, while the group stared at me with no feigned
      astonishment. But already the duchess had vouchsafed a very polite speech,
      and motioned me to a seat beside her; while the chevalier insinuated
      himself among the rest, evidently bent on relieving the stiff and
      constrained reserve which pervaded the party. Not even his tact and
      worldly cleverness was equal to the task. The conversation, if such it
      could be called, was conducted almost in monosyllables,&mdash;some stray
      question for an absent &ldquo;marquise,&rdquo; or a muttered reply concerning a late
      &ldquo;countess,&rdquo; was the burden; not an allusion even being made to any topic
      of the day, nor any phrase dropped which could show that the speakers were
      aware of the year or the nation in which they lived and breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an inexpressible relief to me when gradually some three or four
      other persons dropped in, some of them men, who, by their manner, seemed
      favorites of the party. And soon after the entrance of the servant with
      refreshments permitted a movement in the group, when I took the
      opportunity to stand up and approach Duchesne, as he bent over a table,
      listlessly turning over the leaves of a volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think of the contradictions of human nature, Burke,&rdquo; said he, in a
      low whisper. &ldquo;These are the receptions for which the new noblesse would
      give half their wealth. These melancholy visits of worn-out acquaintances,
      these sapless twigs of humanity, are the envy of such houses as the Hôtel
      Clichy; and to be admitted to these gloomy, moth-eaten <i>salons</i>, is a
      greater honor than an invitation to the Tuileries. So long as this exists,
      depend upon it, there is rottenness in the core of society. But come, let
      us take our leave; I see you are well wearied of all this. And now for an
      hour at Madame de Lacostellerie's,&mdash;<i>en revanche</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we came forward to make our adieux to the duchess, she rose from her
      seat, and in so doing her sleeve brushed against a small marble statue of
      Louis the Sixteenth, which, had I not opportunely caught it, would have
      fallen to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said she, graciously. &ldquo;You have prevented what I should
      have deemed a sad accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, more, Aunt,&rdquo; said Duchesne, smiling; &ldquo;he has shown his readiness to
      restore the Bourbon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech, evidently spoken in jest, was repeated from lip to lip in the
      circle; and certainly I never felt my awkwardness more oppressive than
      when bowing to the party, whose elated looks and pleased countenances now
      were turned towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor, bashful friend,&rdquo; said Duchesne, as we descended the stair; &ldquo;get
      rid of the habit of blushing with all convenient despatch. It has marred
      more fortunes than pharo or bouillotte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, assuredly, is well done!&rdquo; said the chevalier, as he looked around
      him, while we slowly ascended the stairs of the Hôtel Glichy: the
      brilliant light, almost rivalling day; the servants in gorgeous liveries;
      the air of wealth around on every side, so different from the sad-colored
      mansion of the Faubourg; while, as the opening doors permitted it to be
      heard, the sound of delicious music came wafted to the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Burke,&rdquo; said he, stopping suddenly, and laying his hand on my arm,
      &ldquo;this might content a man who has seen as much as I have. And the game is
      well worth the playing; so here goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first person I saw as we entered the ante-chamber was Bubbleton. He
      was the centre of a knot of foreigners, who, whatever the topic, seemed
      highly amused at his discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is your friend, yonder,&rdquo; said Duchesne. &ldquo;He has the true type of
      John Bull about him; introduce me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duchesne scarcely permitted me to finish the introduction, when he
      extended his hand, and saluted Bubbleton with great cordiality; while the
      &ldquo;general&rdquo; did not suffer the ceremony to interrupt the flow of his
      eloquence, but continued to explain, in the most minute and circumstantial
      manner, the conditions of the new peace secretly concluded between France
      and England. The incredulity of the listeners was, I could perceive,
      considerably lessened by observing the deferential attention with which
      Duchesne listened, only interrupting the speaker by an occasional assent,
      or a passing question as to the political relations of some of the great
      Powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to Prussia,&rdquo; said Bubbleton, pompously&mdash;&ldquo;as to Prussia&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of Prussia, General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have our doubts on that subject,&rdquo; replied he, looking thoughtfully
      around him on the group, who, completely deceived by Duchesne's manner,
      now paid him marked attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll not deprive her of Genoa, I trust,&rdquo; said the chevalier, with a
      gravity almost inconceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is done already,&rdquo; said Bubbleton. &ldquo;For my own part, I told
      Lauderdale we were nothing without the Bosphorus,&mdash;'the key of our
      house, as your Emperor called it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke of Russia, if I don't err,&rdquo; said Duchesne, with an insinuating
      air of correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, you are wrong. I know Russia well. I travelled through the
      steppes of Metchezaromizce with Prince Drudeszitsch. We journeyed three
      hundred versts over his own estates, drawn on sledges by his serfs. You
      are aware they are always harnessed by the beard, which they wear long and
      plaited on purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is towards the Crimea,&rdquo; interrupted the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. I remember a curious incident which occurred one night as we
      approached Chitepsk. (You know Chitepsk? It is where they confine the
      state prisoners,&mdash;a miserable, dreary tract, where the snow never
      melts, and the frost is so intense you often see a drove of wolves glued
      fast to the snow by the feet, and howling fearfully: a strange sight, to
      be sure!) Well, the night was falling, and a thin, cutting snowdrift
      beginning to drop, when Dru (I always call him so,&mdash;short) said to
      me,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Bub' (he did the same to me) 'Bub,' said he, 'do you remark that
      off-side leader?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I see him,' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I have been watching the fellow since the last stage, and confound me if
      he has ever tightened a trace; and you see he is a right active one,
      notwithstanding. He capers along gayly enough. I 'll touch him up a bit.'
      And with that he gave a flourish of his knouted whip, and came down on him
      with a smarting cut. Lord, how he jumped! Five feet off the ground at one
      spring! And, hang me, if he didn't tear off his beard! There it was,
      hanging to the pole! A very shocking sight, I must confess; though Dru did
      n't seem to mind it. However, we were obliged to pull up, and get out the
      team. Well, you would not believe what we saw when we got down. You 'd
      never guess who was the off-leader. It was the Princess Odoznovskoi! Poor
      thing! the last time I saw her, before that, she was dancing in the Amber
      Palace with Prince Alexander. She and her husband had been banished to
      Chitepsk, and as he was ill, she had put on a false beard and was taking a
      short stage in his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not venture to wait for more; but, leaving Duchesne to make the most
      of the general, passed onwards towards the <i>salon</i>, which already was
      rapidly filling with visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The countess received me with more than wonted kindness of manner, and
      mademoiselle assumed a tone of actual cordiality I had never perceived
      before; while, as she exchanged greetings with me, she said, in a low
      voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me speak with you, in the picture-gallery, in half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could utter my assent she had passed on, and was speaking to
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat curious to conceive what Mademoiselle de Lacostellerie might mean
      by her appointment in the gallery, I avoided the groups where I perceived
      my acquaintances were, and strolled negligently on towards the place of
      meeting. The gallery was but half lighted, as was customary on mere nights
      of visiting, and I found it quite deserted. I was sauntering slowly along,
      musing on the strange effects of the half-seen pictures, where all, save
      the most forcible and striking tints, were sombred down to blackness, when
      I heard a step behind me. I turned my head, and saw mademoiselle herself.
      She was alone, and, though she evidently had seen me, continued to walk
      onward, without speaking, towards a small boudoir, which occupied one
      angle of the gallery. I followed, and we entered it together.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the secret interview which, while it excited my
      curiosity, served at once to convince me that had I indulged in any hope
      of succeeding to her affections, nothing could be less promising,&mdash;this
      very proof of her confidence was the strongest earnest of her
      indifference. But, indeed, I had never any such expectation. My pride
      might have been flattered by such a supposition; my heart could never have
      sympathized in the emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are alone here,&rdquo; said she, hurriedly, &ldquo;and we may be missed; so let me
      be brief. It will seem strange that I should ask you to meet me here, but
      I could not help it. You alone, of all who frequent this, have never paid
      me the least attention, nor seemed disposed to flatter me; this leads me
      to trust you. I have no other reason but that, and because I am
      friendless.&rdquo; There was a tremulous sadness in the last word which went to
      my heart, and I could mark that her breathing was hurried and irregular
      for some few seconds after. &ldquo;Will you promise me your friendship in what I
      ask? or, if that be too much, will you pledge yourself at least to
      secrecy? Enough, I am quite satisfied. Now, tell me, who is this Chevalier
      Duchesne?&mdash;what is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ran over in a few words all I knew of him, dwelling on whatever might
      most redound to his credit; his distinguished military career, his
      undoubted talent, and, lastly, alluding to his family, to which I
      conceived the question might most probably apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is not that,&rdquo; said she, vehemently, &ldquo;I wish to know. I care not
      for his bravery, nor his birth either. Tell me, what are the sources of
      his power? How is he admitted everywhere, intimate with every one, with
      influence over all? Why does Fouché fear, and Talleyrand admit him? I know
      they do this; and can you give me no clew, however faint, to guide me? The
      Comte de Lacostellerie was refused the Spanish contract; Duchesne
      interferes, and it is given him. There is a difficulty about a card for a
      private concert at St. Cloud; Duchesne sends it. Nor does it end here. <i>You</i>
      know&rdquo;&mdash;here her voice assumed a forced distinctness, as though it
      cost her an effort to speak calmly&mdash;&ldquo;of his duel with the Prince
      Dobretski; but perhaps you may not know how he has obtained an imperial
      order for his recall to St. Petersburg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that I never heard. Can it be possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, then, never tasted of his arbitrary power,&rdquo; said she, smiling
      half superciliously, &ldquo;that these things seem strange to you? or does he
      work so secretly that even those most intimate with him are in ignorance?
      But this must be so.&rdquo; She paused for a second or two, and then went on:
      &ldquo;And now, brief as our acquaintance with him has been, see what influence
      he already possesses over my mother! Even to her I dare not whisper my
      suspicions; while to you, a stranger,&rdquo; added she, with emotion, &ldquo;I must
      speak my fears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are they not groundless?&rdquo; said I, endeavoring to calm the agitation
      she suffered from. &ldquo;In all that you have mentioned, I can but trace the
      devotion of one seeking to serve, not injure; to be loved, not dreaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had I said these words, when I heard a noise behind me, and before
      I could turn round, Duchesne stood beside us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I implore your pardon, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, in a voice of
      well-affected timidity, &ldquo;nor should I venture to interrupt so interesting
      a conference, but that the Comtesse de Lacostellerie had sent me to look
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could scarcely have come more apropos, sir. The conversation was
      entirely of yourself,&rdquo; said she, haughtily, as if in defiance of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I possibly have merited so great an honor, Mademoiselle?&rdquo;
       replied he, bowing with the deepest respect; &ldquo;or is it to the kindness of
      a <i>friend</i> I am indebted for such interest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an evident sneer in the way he uttered the word &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; while
      a sidelong glance he gave beneath his deep eyelashes was still more
      decisive of his feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Few probably owe more to their friends than the Chevalier Duchesne,&rdquo; said
      mademoiselle, tauntingly, as she took my arm to return to the <i>salon</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, most true!&rdquo; replied he, with a low and deferential bow; &ldquo;and I hope
      I am not the man to forget my debts to either friends or enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned round rapidly as he said this. Our eyes met, and we exchanged a
      short, brief glance of open defiance. His, however, as quickly changed;
      and an easy smile of careless indifference succeeded, as he lounged after
      us towards the <i>salon</i>, where now a considerable number of persons
      were assembled, and a more than usual excitement prevailed. Some generals
      of the imperial staff were also there; and the rumor ran that the
      negotiations with England had been suddenly interrupted, and that the
      negotiators had demanded their passports.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not all, Madame,&rdquo; said an old officer to the countess. &ldquo;The
      accounts from Mayence are threatening. Large bodies of Prussian troops are
      reported on the march from the eastward. The telegraph has been actively
      at work since noon, and several couriers have been sent off from the War
      Office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to come next?&rdquo; said the countess, sighing, as she thought of
      Paris once more deserted by its gay Court and brilliant crowd of officers,
      the only society of the period.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next, Madame?&rdquo; said Duchesne, taking up the word. &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i>
      the thing is easily told. A conscription, a march, a bivouac, and a battle
      will form act the first. Then a victory; and a bulletin and an imperial
      edict, showing that Prussia, both by her language and geographical
      position, was intended by Providence to belong to France; that Prussians
      have no dearer wish than to be thrashed and taxed,&mdash;the honor of
      becoming a portion of the Grande Nation being an ample recompense for any
      misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it is, Monsieur,&rdquo; broke in a bluff, hard-featured veteran, whose
      coarse and weather-beaten traits bespoke one risen from the ranks; &ldquo;he is
      no Frenchman who says otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your good health, Colonel,&rdquo; said Duchesne, as he lifted a glass of
      champagne to his lips. &ldquo;Such patriotism is really refreshing in our
      degenerate days. I wish you every success in your campaign; though what is
      to reward your valor in that miserable land of beer and Protestantism I
      cannot possibly conceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow; let me see you to-morrow, in the afternoon.&rdquo; said
      mademoiselle, in a whisper, as she passed close to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I nodded in acknowledgment, Duchesne turned slightly around, and I saw
      in his eyes he had overheard the words, though uttered in a mere whisper.
      Still he went on,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for us who remain ingloriously behind you, we have nothing to do but
      to read your exploits in the 'Moniteur.' And would to Heaven the worthy
      editor would print his battles in better fashion! The whole page usually
      looks more like a beaten than a conquering army; wounded vowels and broken
      consonants at every step, and the capital letters awkward, hard-featured
      fellows, as though risen from the ranks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tonnerre de Dieu</i>, sir! do you mean an insult to me?&rdquo; said the old
      colonel, in a voice which, though intended for a whisper, was heard over
      the whole circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An insult, my dear colonel? nothing within a thousand leagues of such. I
      was only speaking of the 'type' of our army, which may be very efficient,
      but is scarcely too good-looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No words can convey the sarcastic tone in which the speech was delivered,
      nor the mortification of the indignant colonel, who felt, but knew not how
      to reply to, such a taunt. Happily Madame de Lacostellerie interposed, and
      by skilfully changing the topic of conversation, averted further
      unpleasantness.
    </p>
    <p>
      My desire to learn something accurately as to the state of events made me
      anxious to reach my quarters, and I took the first opportunity of quitting
      the <i>salon</i>. As I passed through the outer room, Duchesne was
      standing against a sideboard, holding a glass in his hand. It was
      necessary that I should pass him closely, and I was preparing to salute
      him with the distant courtesy of our present acquaintance, when he said,
      in his former tone of easy raillery,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going so early? Won't you have a glass of wine before you leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; said I, coldly, and going on towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor wait for the concert; Grassini will be here in half an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head in negation; and as I passed out I heard him humming, with
      an emphasis which there was no mistaking, the couplet of a popular song of
      the day which concluded thus,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day for me; To-morrow for thee,&mdash;But will that to-morrow ever
      be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That Duchesne intended to challenge me seemed now almost certain; and I
      ran over in my mind the few names of those I could ask to be my friends on
      such an occasion, but without being able to satisfy myself on the subject.
      A moment's recollection might have taught me that it was a maxim with the
      chevalier never to send a message, but in every case to make the adversary
      the aggressor; he had told me so over and over himself. That, however, did
      not occur to me at the moment, and I walked onward, thinking of our
      meeting. Could I have known what was passing in <i>his</i> mind, I should
      have spared many serious and some sad thoughts to my own.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. A SUDDEN DEPARTURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      So firmly had I persuaded myself, on my way homeward, that Duchesne
      intended a duel with me, that I dreamed of it all night, and awoke in the
      morning perfectly convinced that the event was prearranged between us.
      Now, although the habits of the service I lived in had, in a great
      measure, blunted the feelings I once entertained towards duelling, still
      enough of detestation of the practice remained to make my anticipations
      far from satisfactory; besides, I knew that Duchesne had in reality no
      cause of quarrel with me, but from misapprehension alone could demand a
      meeting, which our military code of honor always decided should be
      accepted first, and inquired into afterwards. I regretted also, and deeply
      too, that I should appear to his eyes in an unworthy part, as though
      betraying the interests he had confided to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, as I have said, many things I liked not in the chevalier: the
      insatiable desire he felt for revenge where he had once been injured; the
      spirit of intrigue he cherished; and, perhaps more than either, I shunned
      the scoffing habit he had of depreciating what every one around him loved
      or respected,&mdash;of stripping off every illusion which made life
      valuable, and reducing to the miserable standard of mere selfish gratification
      all that was great, or noble, or venerable. Already had his evil influence
      done me injury in this way. Even now I felt, that of the few daydreams I
      once indulged in he had robbed me of the best, and reduced me to the sad
      reflection which haunted me throughout my whole career, and imbittered
      every passing enjoyment of my life: I mean, the sorrowful thought of being
      an alien, of having but the hireling's part in that career of glory which
      others followed; that I alone could have no thrill of patriotism, when all
      around me were exulting in its display; that I had neither home nor
      country! Oh! if they who feel, or fancy that they feel, the wrongs and
      oppressions of misgovernment at home,&mdash;who, with high aspirations
      after liberty and holy thoughts for the happiness of their fellow-men, war
      against the despotism which would repress the one or the cruelty which
      would despise the other; if they could only foresee, that in changing
      allegiance they did but shift the burden, not rid themselves of the load;
      that the service of a foreign land is no requital for the loss of every
      feeling which ties a man to kindred and to friends,&mdash;which links his
      manhood with his youth, his age with both,&mdash;which gives him, in the
      language of his forefathers, a sympathy with the land that bore them; if
      they could know and feel these things; if they could learn how, in
      surrendering them, they have made themselves such mere waifs and strays
      upon life's ocean that objects of purely selfish and personal advancement
      must be to them for evermore in place of the higher and more ennobling
      thoughts which mix with other men's ambitions: they might hesitate ere
      they left home and country to fight for the cause of the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      If such thoughts found entrance into <i>my</i> heart, how must they have
      dwelt in many another's? I, who had neither family nor kindred,&mdash;who
      from earliest childhood had never tasted the sweets of affection nor known
      the blessings of a father's love; and yet scarce a day crept by without
      some thought of the far-away land of my birth,&mdash;some memory of its
      hills and valleys, of its green banks and changeful skies: and in my
      dreams, some long-forgotten air would bring me back in memory to the
      cottier's fireside, where around the red blazing turf were seated the poor
      but happy peasantry, beguiling the time with song or story,&mdash;now
      telling of the ancient greatness of their country, now breathing a hope of
      its one day prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Burke's quarters?&rdquo; said a voice without. At the same instant, the
      jingling of spurs and the clank of a sabre bespoke the questioner as a
      soldier. My door opened, and an officer in the full dress of the staff
      entered. As I requested him to be seated, I already anticipated the object
      of his visit, which he seemed determined to open in most diplomatic
      fashion; for, the first salutations over, he began coolly to ransack his
      sabretasche, and search among a heap of papers which crowded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! here it is,&rdquo; said he at length. &ldquo;I ask your pardon for all this
      delay. But, of course, you guess the reason of my being here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess I suspect it,&rdquo; said I, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that I am certain of. These things never are secrets very long; nor,
      for my part, do I think there is any need they should be. I conclude you
      are quite prepared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall find me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the minister said,&rdquo; replied he; while, once more, his eyes were buried
      in the recesses of the sabretasche, leaving me in the most intense
      astonishment at the last few words. That the minister, whoever he might
      be, should know of, and, as it seemed, acquiesce in my fighting a duel,
      was a puzzle I could make nothing of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the note I looked for,&rdquo; said he as he took forth a small slip of
      paper, written on both sides. &ldquo;May I beg you will take down the details;
      they are brief, but important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may trust my memory with them,&rdquo; said I, rather surprised at the
      circumstantial style of his conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please; so pay attention for one moment, while I read: 'Captain
      Burke of the Eighth, will proceed by extra post to Mayence, visiting the
      following garrisons <i>en route</i> '(here come the names, which you can
      copy), where his attention will be specially directed to the points marked
      A. B. and&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive my interrupting you; but really I am unaware of what you are
      alluding to. You are not here on the part of the Chevalier Duchesne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chevalier Duchesne? Duchesne? No; this is a war despatch from the
      minister. You must set out in two hours. I thought you said you were
      prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem! there has been a mistake here,&rdquo; said I, endeavoring to remember how
      far I might have committed myself by any unguarded expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my fault, Captain Burke,&rdquo; said he, frankly. &ldquo;I should have been more
      explicit at first. But I really thought from something&mdash;I forget
      precisely what now&mdash;that you knew of the movement on the frontier,
      and were, in fact, prepared for your orders. Heaven knows how far our
      mystification might have gone on; for when you spoke of Duchesne&mdash;the
      ex-captain of the Imperial Guard, I suppose&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! what of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it so chanced that he was closeted with the minister this morning,
      and only left five minutes before your orders were made out. But come,
      neither of us can well spare more time. This is your despatch for the
      commandant of the troops at Mayence, to whom you will report verbally on
      the equipment of the smaller bodies of men visited <i>en route</i>. I
      shall give you my note, which, though hurriedly written, will assist your
      memory. Above all things, get speedily on the road, and reach Mayence by
      Wednesday. Half an hour's speed in times like these is worth a whole year
      in one's way to promotion. And so, now, good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood for several minutes after he left the room so confused and
      astonished, that had not the huge envelope, with its great seal of office,
      confirmed the fact, I could have believed the whole a mere trick of my
      imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jingle of the postilion's equipment in the court beneath now informed
      me that a Government <i>calèche</i> stood awaiting me, and I speedily
      began my preparations for the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thought filled my mind to the exclusion of all others. It was
      Duchesne's influence on which my fortune now rested. The last few words he
      uttered as I left the <i>salon</i> were ringing in my ears, and here was
      their explanation. This rapid journey was planned by him to remove me from
      Paris, where possibly he supposed my knowledge of him might be
      inconvenient, and where in my absence his designs might be prosecuted with
      more success. Happy as I felt to think that a personal <i>rencontre</i>
      was not to occur between us, my self-love was deeply wounded at the
      thought of how much I was in this man's power, and how arbitrarily he
      decided on the whole question of my destiny. If my pride were gratified on
      the one hand by my having excited the chevalier's vengeance, it was
      offended on the other by feeling how feeble would my efforts prove to
      oppose the will of an antagonist who worked with such secret and such
      powerful means. The same philosophy which so often stood my part in life
      here came to my aid,&mdash;to act well my own part, and leave the result
      to time. And so, with this patient resolve, I mentally bade defiance to my
      adversary, and set out from Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ardent feeling which filled my heart on the approach of my first
      campaign was now changed into a soldierly sense of duty, which, if less
      enthusiastic, was a steadier and more sustaining motive. I felt whatever
      distinctions it should be my lot to win must be gained in the camp, not in
      the Court-, that my place was rather where squadrons were charging and
      squares were kneeling, than among the intrigues of the capital, its wiles
      and its plottings. In the one, I might win an honorable name; in the
      other, I should be but the dupe of more designing heads and less
      scrupulous hearts than my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the third morning from the time of my leaving Paris, I reached
      Mayence. The garrisons which I visited on the road seldom detained me
      above half an hour. The few questions which I had to ask respecting the
      troops were soon and easily answered; and in most instances the officers
      in command had been apprised that their reports would be required, and
      came ready at once to afford the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disposable force at that time was not above eighty thousand new
      levies,&mdash;the conscripts of the past year,&mdash;who, although well
      drilled and equipped, had never undergone the fatigues of a campaign nor
      met an enemy in the field. But beyond the frontier were the veteran
      legions of the Austrian campaign, who, while advancing on their return to
      France, were suddenly halted, and now only awaited the Emperor's orders
      whither they should carry their victorious standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As at the outbreak of all Napoleon's wars, the greatest uncertainty
      prevailed regarding the direction of the army, and in what place and
      against what enemy the first blow was to be struck. The Russian army,
      defeated and routed at Austerlitz, was said to be once more in the field,
      reorganized and strengthened; Austria, it was rumored, was faltering in
      her fealty; but the military preparations of Prussia were no longer a
      secret, and to many it seemed as if, as in the days of the Republic,
      France was about to contend single-handed against the whole of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Prussia the warlike enthusiasm of the people was carried to the very
      highest pitch. The Court, the aristocracy, but more powerful than either,
      the press, stimulated national courage by recalling to their minds the
      famous deeds of the Great Frederick, and bidding them remember that
      Rossbach was won against an army of Frenchmen. The students&mdash;a
      powerful and an organized class&mdash;stood foremost in this patriotic
      movement. Their excited imaginations warmed by the spirit-stirring songs
      of Kërner and Uhland, and glowing with the instincts of that chivalry
      which is a German's birthright, they spread over the country, calling upon
      their fellow-subjects to arise and defend the &ldquo;Vaterland&rdquo; against the
      aggression of the tyrant. So unequivocally was this feeling expressed,
      that even before the negotiations had lost their pacific character, the
      youthful aristocracy of Berlin used to go and sharpen their swords at the
      door-sill of the French ambassador at Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the exalted tone of patriotic enthusiasm the beautiful Queen of Prussia
      most powerfully contributed. The crooked and tortuous windings of
      diplomatic intrigue found no sympathy in her frank and generous nature.
      Belying on the native energy of German character, she bade an open and a
      bold defiance to her country's enemy, and was content to stake all on the
      chances of a battle. The colder and less confident mind of the king was
      rather impelled by the current of popular opinion than induced by
      conviction to the adoption of this daring policy. But once engaged in it,
      he exhibited the rarest fortitude and the most unyielding courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, in brief, was the condition of that people, such the warlike spirit
      they breathed, when in the autumn of 1806 the cry of war resounded from
      the shores of the Baltic to the frontiers of Bohemia. Never was the
      effective strength of the Prussian army more conspicuous. Their cavalry,
      in number and equipment, was confessedly among the first, if not the very
      first, in Europe; while the artillery maintained a reputation which, since
      the days of Frederick, had proclaimed it the most perfect arm of the
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor knew these things well, and did not undervalue them; and it
      was with a very different impression of his present enemy from that which
      filled his mind in the Austrian campaign, that he remarked to Soult, &ldquo;We
      shall want the mattock in this war,&rdquo;&mdash;thereby implying that, against
      such an adversary, fieldworks and intrenchments would be needed, as well
      as the dense array of squadrons and the bristling walls of infantry.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THE SUMMIT OF THE LANDGRAFENBERG
    </h2>
    <p>
      After a brief delay at Mayence, it was with sincere pleasure I received my
      orders to push forward to the advanced posts at Wetzlar, where General
      d'Auvergne was with his division. Already the battalions were crossing the
      Rhine, and directing their steps to different rendezvous along the
      Prussian frontier; some pressing on eastwards, where the Saxon territory
      joins the Prussian; others directly to the north, and taking up positions
      distant by a short day's march from each other. The same urgent haste
      which characterized the opening of the Austrian campaign a year before,
      was here conspicuous; many of the corps being obliged to march seven and
      eight leagues in the day, and frequently whole companies being forwarded
      in wagons drawn by six or eight horses, in order to come up with the main
      body of their regiments. Every road eastward was covered with some
      fragment of the army. Now an infantry corps of young conscripts, glowing
      with enthusiasm and eager for the fray, would cheer the <i>calèche</i> in
      which I travelled, and which, as indicating a staff-officer, was
      surmounted by a small flag with an eagle. Now it was the hoarse challenge
      of an outpost, some veteran of Bernadotte's army, which occupied the whole
      line of country from Dusseldorf to Nuremberg. Pickets of dragoons, with
      troops of led horses for remounts, hurried on, and long lines of wagons
      crammed the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I joined General d'Auvergne, who, with all the ardor of the
      youngest soldier, was preparing for the march. The hardy veteran,
      disdaining the use of a carriage, rode each day at the head of his column,
      and went through the most minute detail of regimental duty with the
      colonels under his command. From whatever cause proceeding I knew not, but
      it struck me as strange that he never alluded to my visit to Paris, nor
      once spoke to me of the countess; and while this reserve on his part
      slightly wounded me, I felt relieved from the embarrassment the mere
      mention of her name would cause me, and was glad when our conversation
      turned on the events of the war. Nor was he, save in this respect, less
      cordial than ever, manifesting the greatest pleasure at the prospect the
      war would open to my advancement, and kindly presaging for me a success I
      scarcely dared to hope for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor is the hour distant,&rdquo; said he to me one morning in the latter end of
      September, as we rode side by side; &ldquo;the grand movement is begun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Augereau, with his powerful <i>corps d'armée</i> of twenty thousand,
      pressed on from Frankfort and Mayence; Bernadotte moved up on his flank
      from Nuremberg and Bamberg; Davoust hastened by forced marches from the
      Danube; while Soult and Ney with a strong force remained in the south, and
      in observation on the Austrian frontier. Farther to the north, again, were
      the new levies and the whole Imperial Guard, strengthened by four thousand
      additional men, which, together with Murat's cavalry, formed a vast line
      embracing the Prussian frontier on the west and south, and converging with
      giant strides towards the very heart of the kingdom. Still, mid all the
      thunders of marching squadrons and the din of advancing legions,
      diplomatists interchanged their respective assurances of a peaceful issue
      to their differences, and politely conveyed the most satisfactory
      sentiments of mutual esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st of September the Emperor left Paris; but, even then, covering
      his designs by an affected hope of peace, he was accompanied by the
      Empress and her suite to Mayence, where all the splendor of a Court was
      suddenly displayed amid the pomp and preparation of war. On the 6th he
      started by daybreak; relays of horses were in waiting along the road to
      Wetzlar, and with all speed he hastened forward to Bamberg, where he
      issued his grand proclamation to the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his accustomed eloquence he represented to the army the insulting
      demands of Prussia, and called on them, as at Austerlitz, to reply to such
      a menace by one tremendous blow of victory, which should close the
      campaign. &ldquo;Soldiers!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you were about to return to France to
      enjoy the well-won repose after all your victories. But an enemy is in the
      field; the road to Paris is no longer open to you: neither you nor I can
      tread it save under an arch of triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day which succeeded the issue of this proclamation, a cavalry affair
      occurred at the advanced posts, in which the Prussians were somewhat the
      victors. Two days later, a courier arrived at the imperial headquarters
      with the account of another and more important action, between the
      grenadiers of Lannes and a part of Suchet's corps, against the advanced
      guard of Prince Hohenlohe, commanded by the most daring general in the
      Prussian service,&mdash;Prince Louis. A cavalry combat, which lasted for
      near an hour, closed this brief but bloody encounter with the death of the
      brave prince, who, refusing to surrender, was run through the body by the
      sabre of a quartermaster of the Tenth Hussars.
    </p>
    <p>
      General d'Auvergne's brigade had no share in this memorable action, for on
      the 9th we were marched to Rudolstadt, some miles to the left of the scene
      of the encounter; but having made a demonstration in that quarter, were
      speedily recalled, and ordered with all haste to cross the Saale, and move
      on to the eastward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now that Napoleon's manoeuvres became apparent. The same intrigue
      which succeeded at Ulm was again to be employed here: the enemy's flank
      was to be turned, the communication with his reinforcements cut off, and a
      battle engaged, in which defeat must prove annihilation. Such, then, was
      the complete success of the Emperor's movements, that on the 12th the
      French army was posted with the rear upon the Elbe, while the Prussians
      occupied a line between them and the Rhine. This masterly movement at once
      compelled the enemy to fall back and concentrate his troops around Jena
      and Weimar, which, from that instant, Napoleon pronounced must be the
      scene of a great battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this detail I have been obliged to force on my reader, and now again
      return to my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 13th, Murat appeared for the first time at our
      headquarters, below Jena; and after a short consultation with the staff,
      our squadrons were formed and ordered to push on with haste towards Jena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything now showed that the decisive hour could not be distant:
      couriers passed and repassed; messengers and orderlies met us at every
      step; while, as is ever the case, the most contradictory rumors were
      circulated about the number and position of the enemy. As we neared
      Lausnitz, however, we learned that the whole Prussian army occupied the
      plateau of Jena, save a corps of twenty thousand men which were stationed
      at Auerstadt. From the elevated spot we occupied, the columns of Marshal
      Berna-dotte's division could be seen marching to the eastward. A halt was
      now commanded, and the troops prepared their bivouacs; when, as night was
      falling, a staff-officer rode up, with orders from the Emperor himself to
      push on without delay for Jena.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road was much cut up by the passage of cavalry and wagons, and as the
      night was dark, our pace was occasionally impeded. I was riding with one
      of the leading squadrons, when General d'Auvergne directed me to take an
      orderly with me, and proceed in advance to make arrangements for the
      quarters of the men at Jena. Selecting a German soldier as my guide, I
      dashed forwards, and soon left the squadron out of hearing. We had not
      gone far, when I remarked, from the tramp of the horses, that we were upon
      an earthen road, and not on the pavement. I questioned my orderly, but he
      was positive there had been no turning since we started. I paid no more
      attention to the circumstance, but rode on, hard as ever. At last the clay
      became deeper and heavier, the sides of the way closer, and all the
      appearance, as well as the gloom would allow us to guess, rather those of
      a byroad than the regular <i>chaussée</i>. To return would have been
      hopeless; the darkness gave no prospect of detecting at what precise spot
      we had left the main road, and so I determined to make my way straight
      onwards at all hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about an hour's fast trotting, the orderly, who rode some paces in
      advance, called out, &ldquo;A light!&rdquo; and then, the moment after, he cried,
      &ldquo;There are several lights yonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I reined in my horse at once, for the thought struck me that we had come
      down upon the Prussian lines. Giving my horse to the soldier, with orders
      to follow me noiselessly at a little distance, I walked on for above a
      mile, my eyes steadily fixed upon the lights, which moved from place to
      place, and showed, by their taper glare, that they were not watchfires. At
      length I gained a little ridge of the ground, and could distinctly see
      that it was a line of guns and artillery wagons, endeavoring to force
      their way through a narrow ravine; a few minutes after, I heard the sounds
      of French, and relieved of all apprehensions, I mounted my horse and soon
      came up with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were four troops of Lannes's artillery, which, by a mistake similar
      to my own, had left the highroad and entered one of the field-tracks,
      which thus led them astray; and here they were, jammed up in a narrow
      gorge, unable to get back or forward. The officer in command was a young
      colonel, who was completely overwhelmed by his misfortune; for he informed
      me that the whole artillery of the division was following him, and would
      inevitably be involved in the same mishap. The poor fellow, who doubtless
      would have faced the enemy without a particle of fear, was now so
      horrified by the event, that he ran wildly from place to place, ordering
      and counter-ordering every instant, and actually increasing the confusion
      by his own excitement. Some of the leading trains were unharnessed, and
      efforts made to withdraw the guns from their position; but the axles were,
      on both sides, embedded in the rock, and seemed to defy every effort to
      disengage them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, when the confusion had reached its height, and the horses
      were unharnessed from the guns, the men standing in groups around or
      shouting wildly to one another, a sullen silence spread itself over the
      whole, and a loud, stern voice called out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who commands this division?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Latour,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; said the first speaker, so close to my ear that I started
      round, and saw the short square figure of a man in a great coat, holding a
      heavy whip in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the main body at the rear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannoneers, dismount!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Bring the torches to the front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely was the order obeyed, when the light of the firewood fell upon
      his features, and I saw it was the Emperor himself. In an instant the
      whole scene was changed. The park tools were taken out, working parties
      formed, and the ravine began to echo to the strong blows of the brawny
      arms; while Napoleon, with a blazing torch in his hand, stood by to light
      their labors. Giving directions to the under-officers and the men, he
      never deigned a word to the officers, who now stood trembling around him,
      and were gradually joined by several more, who came up with the remainder
      of the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think still I can see that pale, unmoved face, which, as the light
      flickered upon it, gazed steadily at the working party. Not a syllable
      escaped him, save once, when he muttered half to himself, &ldquo;And this was
      the first battery to open its fire to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Savary stood at his side, but never dared to address him. Too well
      he knew that his deepest anger showed itself by silence. By degrees the
      granite wall gave way, the axles once more became free, and the horses
      were again harnessed; the gun-carriages moved slowly through the ravine.
      Nor did the Emperor quit the spot before the greater part of the train
      passed; then mounting his horse, he turned towards Jena, and
      notwithstanding the utter darkness of the night he rode at full speed.
      Following the clatter of the horse's hoofs, I rode on, and in less than an
      hour reached a small cluster of houses, where a cavalry picket was placed,
      and several large fires were lighted, beside which, at small tables, sat
      above a dozen staff-officers busily writing despatches. The Emperor halted
      but for a second or two, and then dashed forward again; and I soon
      perceived we were ascending a steep hill, covered with ferns and
      brushwood. We had not gone far, when a single aide-de-camp who accompanied
      him turned his horse's head and rode rapidly down the mountain again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Napoleon was now alone, some fifty paces in front. I could see the faint
      outline through the darkness, my sight guided by my hearing to the spot.
      His pace, wherever the ground permitted, was rapid; but constantly he was
      obliged to hold in, and pick his steps among the stones and dwarf wood
      that covered the mountain. Never shall I cease to remember the strange
      sensations I felt as I followed him up that steep ascent. There was he,
      the greatest monarch of the universe, alone, wending his solitary way in
      darkness, his thoughts bent on the great event before him,&mdash;the
      tremendous conflict in which thousands must fall. There was a sense of awe
      in the thought of being so near to one on whose slightest word the destiny
      of nations seemed to hang; and I could not look on the dark object before
      me without a superstitious feeling, deeper than fear itself, for that
      mightiest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      My thoughts permitted my taking no note of time, and I know not how long
      it was before we reached the crest of the hill, over whose bleak surface a
      cold, cutting wind was blowing. It seemed as if a great tableland extended
      now for some distance on every side, over which the Emperor took his way,
      as though accustomed to the ground. While I was wondering at the certainty
      with which he appeared to determine on his road, I remarked the feeble
      flickering of a light far away towards the horizon, and by which it was
      evident he guided his steps. As we rode on, several watchfires could be
      seen towards the northwest, stretching away to a great distance, and
      throwing a yellowish glare in the dark sky above them. Suddenly I
      perceived the Emperor halt and dismount, and as speedily again he was in
      the saddle; but now his path took a different direction, and diverged
      considerably to the southward. Curious to learn what might have caused his
      change of direction, I rode up to the spot, and got off. It was the embers
      of a watchfire; they were almost extinguished, but still, as the horse's
      hoof struck the wood, a few sparks were emitted. It was this, then, which
      altered his course; and once more he pressed his horse to speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A steep ascent of some hundred yards lay before us now. But on gaining the
      top, a brilliant spectacle of a thousand watchfires met the eye: so close
      did they seem, it looked like one great volcanic crater blazing on the
      mountain top; while above, the lurid glow reddened the black sky, and
      melted away into the darkness in clouds of faint yellowish hue. Far, very
      far away, and to the north, stretched another much longer line of fires,
      but at great intervals apart, and occupying, as well as I might guess,
      about two leagues in extent. Several smaller fires dotted the plain,
      marking the outpost positions; and it was not difficult to trace the
      different lines of either army even by these indications.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I yet looked, the Emperor had gained a short distance in advance of
      me; and suddenly I heard the hoarse challenge of a sentry, calling out,
      &ldquo;Qui vive?&rdquo; Buried in his own thoughts,&mdash;perhaps far too deeply lost
      in meditation to hear the cry,&mdash;Napoleon never replied nor slackened
      his speed. &ldquo;Qui vive?&rdquo; shouted the voice again: and before I could
      advance, the sharp bang of a musket-shot rang out; another and another
      followed; and then a roll of fire swept along the plain, happily not in
      the direction of the Emperor. But already he had thrown himself from his
      horse, and lay flat upon the ground.
    </p>

      <img src="images/264.jpg" alt="264 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Not a moment was now to be lost. I dashed my spurs into my jaded horse,
      and rode forwards, calling aloud, at the top of my voice, &ldquo;The Emperor!
      the Emperor!&rdquo; Still, the panic overbore my words, and another discharge
      was given: with one bullet I was struck in the shoulder, another killed my
      horse; but springing to my legs in an instant, I rushed on, repeating my
      cry. Before I could do more than point to the spot, Napoleon came forward,
      leading his horse by the bridle. His step was slow and measured, and his
      face&mdash;for many a torchlight was now gathered to the place&mdash;was
      calm and tranquil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye are well upon the alert, <i>mes enfant!</i>&rdquo; said he, with a smile;
      &ldquo;see that ye be as ready with your fire to-morrow!&rdquo; A wild cheer answered
      these words, while he continued: &ldquo;These are the new levies, Lieutenant;
      the Guards would have had more patience. Where is the officer who followed
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Sire,&rdquo; said I, endeavoring to conceal the appearance of being
      wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount, sir, and accompany me to headquarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My horse is killed, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>parbleu!</i>&rdquo; said a young soldier, who had not learned much
      respect before his superiors; &ldquo;and he has a ball in his neck himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you wounded?&rdquo; said the Emperor, with a quickness in his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere flesh-wound in the arm,&mdash;of no consequence, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the surgeon of the detachment see to this at once, Lieutenant,&rdquo; said
      he to the officer of the party; &ldquo;and do you come to headquarters when you
      are able.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this, the Emperor mounted again, and in a few seconds more was lost
      to our sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ventrebleu!</i>&rdquo; said the old lieutenant, who had served without
      promotion from the first battles of the Republic, &ldquo;you'll be a colonel for
      that scratch on your epaulette, if we only beat the Prussians to-morrow;
      and here am I, with eight wounds from lead and steel, and the Petit
      Caporal never bade me visit him at his bivouac. Come, come! I don't wish
      to be unfriendly; it's not <i>your</i> fault, it's only <i>my</i> bad
      fortune. And here comes the surgeon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant was right,&mdash;the epaulette had the worst of the
      adventure; and, in half an hour I proceeded on my way to headquarters.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. L'HOMME ROUGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On my way to the imperial quarters, I fell in with some squadrons of our
      dragoons, from whom I learned that General d'Auvergne had just received
      orders to repair to the Emperor's bivouac, to which several officers in
      command were also summoned. As I saw, therefore, that I could have no
      prospect of meeting the Emperor, I resolved merely to hold myself in
      readiness, should he, which seemed little likely, think of me; and
      accordingly I took up my post with some young under-officers of our
      brigade, at a huge fire, where a species of canteen had been established,
      and coffee and corn-brandy were served out to all comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recent escape of Napoleon at the outposts was already known far and
      near, and formed the great topic of conversation, in which, I felt hurt to
      remark, no mention of the part I took was ever made, although there were
      at least a dozen different versions of the accident. In one, his Majesty
      was represented to have rode down upon and sabred the advanced picket; in
      another, it was the Prussians who fired, he having penetrated within their
      lines to reconnoitre,&mdash;each agreeing in the one great fact, that the
      feat was something which no one save himself could have done or thought
      of. As for me, I felt it was not my part to speak of the incident at all
      until his Majesty should first do so. I listened, therefore, with due
      patience and some amusement to the various narratives about me; which
      served to show me, by one slight instance, the measure of that
      exaggeration with which the Emperor's name was ever treated, and convinced
      me that it required not time nor distance to color every incident of his
      life with the strongest hues of romance. The topic was a fruitful and
      favorite one; and certainly few subjects could with more propriety season
      the hours around a bivouac fire than the exploits of the Emperor Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those whose reminiscences went farthest back was an old
      sergeant-major of infantry,&mdash;a seared and seamed and weather-beaten
      little fellow, who, from fatigues and privations, was dried up to a mass
      of tendons and fibres. This little man presented one of those strange
      mixtures with which the army abounded,&mdash;the shrewdest common sense on
      all ordinary topics, with a most credulous faith in any story where
      Napoleon's name occurred. It seemed, indeed, as though that one element,
      occurring in any tale, dispensed at once with the rules which govern
      belief in common cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invulnerability of the Emperor was with him a fruitful theme; and he
      teemed with anecdotes of the Egyptian and Italian campaigns, in which it
      was incontestably shown that neither shot nor shell had any effect upon
      him. But of all the superstitions regarding Napoleon, none had such
      complete hold on his imagination, nor was more implicitly believed by him,
      than the story of that little &ldquo;Red Man,&rdquo; who, it was asserted, visited the
      Emperor the night before each great battle, and arranged with him the
      manoeuvres of the succeeding day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L'Homme Bouge,&rdquo; as he was called, was an article of faith in the French
      army that few of the soldiers ever thought of disputing. Some from pure
      credulity, some from the force of example, and some again from indolence,
      believed in this famed personage; but even the veriest scoffer on more
      solemn subjects would have hesitated ere he ventured to assail the almost
      universal belief in this supernatural agency. The Emperor's well-known
      habit of going out alone to visit pickets and outposts on the eve of a
      battle was a circumstance too favorable to this superstition not to be
      employed in its defence. Besides, it was well known that he spent hours by
      himself, when none even of the marshals had access to him; and on these
      occasions it was said &ldquo;L'Homme Bouge&rdquo; was with him. Sentinels had been
      heard to declare that they could overhear angry words passing between the
      Emperor and his guest; that threats had been interchanged between them;
      and on one occasion it was said that the &ldquo;Red Man&rdquo; went so 'far as to
      declare, that if his advice were neglected Napoleon should lose the
      battle, see his artillery fall into the hands of the enemy, and behold the
      Guard capitulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mille tonnerres!</i> what are you saying?&rdquo; broke in the little man, to
      the grim old soldier who was relating this. &ldquo;You know nothing of 'L'Homme
      Rouge,'&mdash;not a word; how should you? But I served in the
      Twenty-second of the Line, old Mongoton's corps; the 'Faubourg Devils,' as
      they were called. <i>He</i> knew him well; it was 'L'Homme Rouge' had him
      shot for treason at Cairo. I was one of the company drawn for his
      execution; and when he knelt down on the grass, he held up his hand this
      way, and cried out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Voltigeurs of the Line, hear me! You have all known me many years; you
      have seen whether I could face the enemy like a man; and you can tell
      whether I cared for the heaviest charge that ever shook a square. You
      know, also, whether I was true to our general. Well, it is &ldquo;L'Homme Rouge&rdquo;
       who has brought me to this. And now: Carry arms!&mdash;all together! Come,
      <i>mes enfants!</i> try it again: Carry arms! (ay, that's better) present
      arms! fire!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Morbleu!</i> the word was not well out when he was dead; and there,
      through the smoke, as plain as I see you now, I saw the figure of a little
      fellow, dressed in scarlet,&mdash;feather and boots all the same! He was
      standing over the corpse, and threatening it with his hands. And that,&rdquo;
       said he, in a solemn voice, &ldquo;that was 'L'Homme Rouge!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This anecdote was conclusive. There was no gainsaying the assertions of a
      man who had, with his own eyes, seen the celebrated &ldquo;Red Man;&rdquo; and from
      that instant he enjoyed a decided monopoly of everything that concerned
      his private history.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the sergeant-major's version,&mdash;and who could venture to
      contradict him?&mdash;&ldquo;L'Homme Rouge&rdquo; was not the confidential adviser and
      friendly counsellor of the Emperor; but, on the contrary, his evil genius,
      perpetually employed in thwarting his plans and opposing his views. Each
      seemed to have his hour of triumph alternately. Now it was the Bed Man,
      now Napoleon, who stood in the ascendant. Fortune for a long period had
      been constant to the Emperor, and victory crowned every battle. This had,
      it seemed, greatly chagrined &ldquo;L'Homme Bouge,&rdquo; who for years past had not
      been seen nor heard of. The last tradition of him was a story told by one
      of the sentinels on guard at the general's quarters at Mont Tabor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight: all was still and silent in the camp. The soldiers slept
      as men sleep before a battle, when the old grenadier who walked his short
      post before General Bonaparte's tent heard a quick tread approaching him.
      &ldquo;Qui vive?&rdquo; cried he; but there was no reply. &ldquo;Qui vive?&rdquo; called the
      sentry once more; but as he did so he leaped backwards and brought his
      musket to the charge, for just then something brushed close by him and
      entered the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two he doubted what should be done. Should he turn out the
      guard? It was only to be laughed at; that would never do. But what if it
      really were somebody who had penetrated to the general's quarters? As this
      thought struck him, he crept up close to the tent; and there, true enough,
      he heard the voices of two persons speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! thou here?&rdquo; said Bonaparte. &ldquo;I scarce expected to see thee so far
      from France!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the other, with a deep sigh, &ldquo;what land is now open to me, or
      whither shall I fly to? I took refuge in Brussels; well, what should I see
      one morning, but the tall shakos of your grenadiers coming up the steep
      street. I fled to Holland; you were there the day after. 'Come,' thought
      I, 'he's moving northwards; I'll try the other extreme.' So I started for
      the Swiss. <i>Sacrebleu</i>! the roll of your confounded drums resounded
      through every valley. I reached the banks of the Po; your troops were
      there the same evening. I pushed for Rome; they were preparing your
      quarters, which you occupied that night. Away, then, I start once more; I
      cross mountains and rivers and seas, and gain the desert at last. I thank
      my fortune that there are a thousand leagues between us; and here you are
      now. For pity's sake, show me, on that map of the world, one little spot
      you don't want to conquer, and let me live there in peace, and be sure
      never to meet you more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bonaparte did not speak for some minutes, and it seemed as though he were
      intently considering the request of &ldquo;L'Homme Rouge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he at length, &ldquo;there! You see that island in the great sea,
      with nothing near it; thou mayest go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it called?&rdquo; said &ldquo;L'Homme Rouge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. Helena,&rdquo; said the general. &ldquo;It is not very large; but I promise thee
      to be undisturbed there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 'll never come there, then? Is that a pledge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never; I promise it. At least, if I do, thou shalt be the master, and I
      the slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! I go now. Adieu!&rdquo; said the little man. And the same instant the
      sentinel felt his arm brushed by some one passing close beside him; and
      then all was silent in the tent once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus, you see,&rdquo; said the sergeant-major, &ldquo;from that hour it was agreed on
      the Emperor should conquer the whole world, and leave that one little spot
      for 'L'Homme Rouge.' <i>Parbleu!</i> he might well spare him that much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How big might it be, that island?&rdquo; said an old grenadier, who listened
      with the deepest attention to the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to speak of; about the size of one battalion drawn up in square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> a small kingdom too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it would not do for the Emperor,&rdquo; said the sergeant-major, laughing,&mdash;an
      emotion the others joined in at once; and many a jest went round at the
      absurdity of such a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat beside the watchfire, listening to the old campaigning stories, till
      one by one the speakers dropped off to sleep. The bronzed veteran and the
      boy conscript, the old soldier of the Sambre and the beardless youth, lay
      side by side: to some of these it was the last time they should slumber on
      earth. As the night wore on, the sounds became hushed in the camp, and
      through the thin frosty air I could hear from a long distance off the
      tramp of the patrols and the challenge of the reliefs as the outposts were
      visited. The Prussian sentries were quite close to our advanced posts, and
      when the wind came from that quarter, I often heard the voices as they
      exchanged their signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the entire night, officers came and went to and from the tent of
      the Emperor. To him, at least, it seemed no season of repose. At length,
      when nigh morning, wearied with watching and tired out with expectancy, I
      leaned my head on my knees, and dropped into a half-sleep. Some vague
      sense of disappointment at being forgotten by the Emperor, was the last
      thought I had as I fell off, and in its sadness it colored all my dreams.
      I remembered, with all the freshness of a recent event, the curse of the
      old hag on the morning I had quitted my home forever,&mdash;her prayer
      that bad luck should track me every step through life; and in the shadowy
      uncertainty of my sleeping thoughts I believed I was predestined to
      misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost every man has experienced the fact, that there are times in life
      when impressions, the slightest in their origin, will have an undue weight
      on the mind; when, as it were, the clay of our natures become softened,
      and we take the impress of passing events more easily. Some vague and
      shadowy conception&mdash;a doubt, a dream&mdash;is enough at moments like
      these to attain the whole force of a conviction; and it is wonderful with
      what ingenuity we wind to our purpose every circumstance around us, and
      what pains we take to increase the toils of our self-deception. It would
      be a curious thing to trace out how much of our good or evil fortune in
      life had its source in these superstitions; how far the frame of mind
      fashioned the events before it; and to what extent our hopes and fears
      were but the forerunners of destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sleeping thoughts were of the saddest; and when I awoke, I could not
      shake them off. A heavy, dense fog clothed every object around, through
      which only the watchfires were visible, as they flared with a yellow, hazy
      light of unnatural size. The position of these signals was only to mark
      the inequality of the ground: and I now could perceive that we occupied
      the crest of a long and steep hill, down the sides and at the bottom of
      which fires were also burning; while in front another mountain arose,
      whose summit for a great distance was marked out by watchfires. This I
      conjectured, from its extent and position, to be the Prussian line.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the front of the Emperor's quarters several led horses were standing,
      whose caparison bespoke them as belonging to the staff; and although not
      yet five o'clock, there was an appearance of movement which indicated
      preparation. The troops, however, were motionless; the dense columns
      covered the ground like a garment, and stirred not. As I stood, uncertain
      what course to take, I heard the noise of voices and the heavy tramp of
      many feet near, and on turning perceived it was the Emperor, who came
      forth from his tent, followed by several of his staff. A large fire blazed
      in front of his bivouac, which threw its long light on the group; where,
      even in a fleeting glance, I recognized General Gazan, and Nansouty, the
      commander of the Cuirassiers of the Guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hour is it?&rdquo; said the Emperor to Duroc, who stood near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost five o'clock, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is darker than it was an hour ago. Maison, where is Bernadotte by
      this?&mdash;at Domberg, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, Sire; he is no laggard if he reach it in three hours hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ney would have been there now,&rdquo; was the quick reply of Napoleon. &ldquo;Come,
      gentlemen, into the saddle, and let us move towards the front. Gazan, put
      your division under arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general waited not a second bidding, but wheeled his horse suddenly
      round, and followed by his aide-decamp, rode at full speed down the
      mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the first streak of day,&rdquo; said the Emperor, pointing to a faint
      gray light above the distant forest; &ldquo;it breaks like Austerlitz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May it set as gloriously!&rdquo; said old Nansouty, in his deep low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it will,&rdquo; said Napoleon. &ldquo;What sayest thou, <i>grognard?</i>&rdquo;
       continued he, turning with an affected severity of manner to the grenadier
      who stood sentinel on the spot, and who, with a French soldier's easy
      indifference, leaned on the cross of his musket to listen to the
      conversation; &ldquo;what sayest thou? Art eager to be made corporal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i>&rdquo; growled out the rough soldier, &ldquo;the grade is little to
      boast of; were I even a general of division, there might be something to
      hope for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo; said Napoleon, sharply, &ldquo;what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King of Prussia, to be sure; thou 'lt give away the title before this
      hour to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor laughed aloud at the conceit. Its flattery had a charm for him
      no courtier's well-turned compliment could vie with; and I could hear him
      still continuing to enjoy it as he rode slowly forward and disappeared in
      the gloom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. JENA AND AUERSTÄDT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has forgotten me!&rdquo; said I, half aloud, as I watched the retiring
      figures of the Emperor and his staff till they were concealed by the mist;
      &ldquo;he has forgotten me! Now to find out my brigade. A great battle is before
      us, and there may still be a way to refresh his memory.&rdquo; With such
      thoughts I set forward in the direction of the picket-fires, full sure
      that I should meet some skirmishers of our cavalry there.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I went, the drums were beating towards the distant left, and gradually
      the sounds crept nearer and nearer, as the infantry battalions began to
      form and collect their stragglers. A dense fog seemed to shut out the
      dawn, and with a thin and misty rain, the heavy vapor settled down upon
      the earth, wrapping all things in a darkness deep as night itself. From
      none could I learn any intelligence of the cavalry quarter, nor had any of
      those I questioned seen horsemen pass near them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The voltigeurs in the valley yonder may perhaps tell you something,&rdquo; said
      an officer to me, pointing to some fires in a deep glen beneath us. And
      thither I now bent my steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dull rolling of the drums gradually swelled into one continued roar,
      through which the clank of steel and the tremulous tramp of marching
      columns could be heard. Spirit-stirring echoes were they, these awakening
      sounds of coming conflict! and how they nerved my heart, and set it
      bounding again with a soldier's ardor! As I descended the hill, the noise
      became gradually fainter, till at length I found myself in a narrow
      ravine, still and silent as the grave itself. The transition was so sudden
      and unexpected, that for a moment I felt a sense of loneliness and
      depression; and the thought struck me, &ldquo;What if I have pushed on too far?
      Can it be that I have passed our lines? But the officer spoke of the
      voltigeurs in front; I had seen the fires myself; there could be no doubt
      about it.&rdquo; I now increased my speed, and in less than half an hour gained
      a spot where the ground became more open and extended in front, and not
      more than a few hundred paces in advance were the watchfires; and as I
      looked I heard the swell of a number of voices singing in chorus on
      different sides of me. The effect was most singular, for the sounds came
      from various quarters at the same instant, and, as they all chanted the
      same air, the refrain rang out and filled the valley; beating time with
      their feet, they stepped to the tune, and formed themselves to the melody,
      as though it were the band of the regiment. I had often heard that this
      was a voltigeur habit, but never was witness to it before. The air was one
      well known in that suburb of Paris whence the wildest and most reckless of
      our soldiers came, and which they all joined in celebrating in this rude
      verse:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Picardy first, and then Champagne,&mdash;
            France to the battle! on boys, on!
            Anjou, Brittany, and Maine,&mdash;
            Hurrah for the Faubourg of St. Antoine I

     &ldquo;How pleasant the life of a voltigeur!
           In the van of the fight he must ever be;
           Of roughing and rations he 's always sure,&mdash;
           With a comrade's share he may well make free.

     &ldquo;Picardy first, and then Champagne,&mdash;
           France to the battle I on boys, on!
           Anjou, Brittany, and Maine,&mdash;
           Hurrah for the Faubourg of St. Antoine!

     &ldquo;The great guns thunder on yonder hill,&mdash;
           Closer than that they durst not go;
           But the voltigeur comes nearer still,&mdash;
           With his bayonet fixed he meets the foe.

    &ldquo;The hussar's coat is slashed with gold;
         He rides an Arab courser fleet:
         But is the voltigeur less bold
         Who meets his enemy on his feet?

    &ldquo;The cuirassier is clad in steel;
         His massive sword is straight and strong:
         But the voltigeur can charge and wheel
         With a step,&mdash;his bayonet is just as long.

    &ldquo;The artillery-driver must halt his team
         If the current be fast or the water deep:
         But the voltigeur can swim the stream,
         And climb the bank, be it e'er so steep.

    &ldquo;The voltigeur needs no trumpet sound,&mdash;
         No bugle has he to cheer him on:
         Where the fire is hottest, that 's his ground,&mdash;
         Hurrah for the Faubourg of St. Antoine!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As they came to the conclusion of this song, they kept up the air without
      words, imitating by their voices the roll of the drum in marching time.
      Joining the first party I came up with, I asked the officer in what
      direction of the field I should find the cuirassier brigade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I can't tell you, Comrade,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No cavalry have appeared in
      our neighborhood, nor are they likely; for all the ground is cut up and
      intersected so much they could not act. But our maître d'armes is the
      fellow to tell you. Halloo, François! come up here for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could ask whether this was not my old antagonist at Elchingen,
      the individual himself appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what?&rdquo; cried he, as he lifted a piece of firewood from the ground,
      and stared me in the face by its light. &ldquo;Not my friend Burke, eh? By Jove!
      so it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our cordial greetings being over, I asked Maître François if he could give
      me any intelligence of D'Auvergne's division, or put me in the way to
      reach them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're some miles off by this time,&rdquo; said he, coolly. &ldquo;When I was below
      the Plateau de Jena last night, that brigade you speak of got their orders
      to push forward to Auerstadt, to support Davoust's infantry. I mind it
      well, for they were sorely tired, and had just picketed their horses, when
      the orderly came down with the despatch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where does Auerstadt lie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About four leagues to the other side of that tall mountain yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, shall I do? I am dismounted, to begin with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you were not, if you had the best horse in the whole brigade, what
      would it serve you now, except to pass the day riding between two
      battle-fields, and see nothing of either? for we shall have hot work here,
      depend upon it. No, no; stay with us. Be a voltigeur for to-day, and we
      'll show you something you 'll not see from your bearskin saddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall be in a sad scrape on account of my absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that; the man that takes his turn with the voltigeurs of the
      Twenty-second won't be suspected of skulking. And here comes the major;
      report yourself to him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for any reply, Maître Francois accosted the officer in
      question, and in a very few words explained my position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could come better timed,&rdquo; said the major. &ldquo;One of ours has been
      sent with despatches to the rear, and we may not see him for some hours.
      Again, a light cavalryman must know how to skirmish, and we 'll try your
      skill that way. Come along with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To our next meeting, then,&rdquo; cried Francois, as I hurried on after the
      major; whilst once more the voltigeur ranks burst forth in full chorus,
      and the merry sounds filled the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed the major down a somewhat steep and rugged path, at the foot of
      which, and concealed by a low copse-wood, was a party consisting of two
      companies of the regiment, who formed the most advanced pickets, and were
      destined to exchange the first shots with the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before us lay a defile, partly overgrown with trees on either side, which
      ascended by a gradual slope to the foot of the hill on which the Prussian
      infantry was stationed, and whose lines were tracked out by a long train
      of watch-fires. A farmhouse and its out-buildings occupied the side of the
      hill about half-way up; and this was garrisoned by the enemy, and defended
      by two guns in position in the defile. To surprise the post and hold it
      until the main columns came up, was the object of the voltigeur attack;
      and for this purpose small bodies of men were assembling secretly and
      stealthily under cover of the brushwood, to burst forth on the word being
      given.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something which surprised me not a little in the way all these
      movements were effected. Officers and men were mixed up, as it seemed, in
      perfect confusion; not approaching in regular order, or taking up a
      position like disciplined troops, they came in twos and threes, crouching
      and creeping, and suddenly concealing themselves at every opportunity of
      cover the ground afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their noiseless and cautious gestures brought to my mind all that I had
      ever read of Indian warfare; and in their eager faces, and quick, piercing
      looks, I thought I could recognize the very traits of the red men. The
      commands were given by signals; and so rapidly interchanged were they from
      party to party, that the different groups seemed to move forward by one
      impulse, though the officer who led them was full a mile distant from
      where we were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you use a firelock, comrade?&rdquo; said the major, as he placed in my hand
      a short musket, such as the voltigeurs carried. &ldquo;Sling it at your back;
      you may find it useful up yonder. And now I must leave you; keep to this
      party. But what is this? You mustn't wear that shako; you'd soon be picked
      off with that tower of black fur on your head. Corporal, have you no spare
      foraging-cap in your kit? Ah! that's something more becoming a tirailleur;
      and, by Jove! I think it improves you wonderfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The circumstance of becomingness was not exactly uppermost in my mind at
      the moment; but certainly I felt no small gratification at being provided
      with the equipment both of cap and firearms which placed me on an equality
      with those about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the major left us, when the corporal crept closely to my
      side, and with that mingled respect and familiarity a French sous-officier
      assumes so naturally, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wished to see something of a skirmish, Captain, I suppose? Well,
      you're like enough to be gratified; we're closing up rapidly now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What may be the strength of your battalion, Corporal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve hundred men, sir; and they're every one at this instant in the
      valley, though I'll wager you don't see a bough move nor a leaf stirring
      to show where they lie hid. You see that low copse yonder; well, there's a
      company of ours beneath its shelter. But there goes the word to move on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A motion with his sword, the only command he gave, communicated the order;
      and the men, creeping stealthily on, obeyed the mandate, till at another
      signal they were halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the little copse of brushwood where we now lay, to the farmhouse, the
      ground was completely open,&mdash;not a shrub nor a bush grew; a slight
      ascent of the road led up to the gate, which could not be more than three
      hundred paces in front of us. We were stationed at some distance to the
      right of the road, but the field presented no obstacle or impediment to
      our attack; and thither now were our looks turned,&mdash;the short road
      which would lead to victory or the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      From my ambush I could see the two fieldpieces which commanded the road,
      and beside which the artillerymen stood in patient attention. With what a
      strange thrill I watched one of the party, as from time to time he stooped
      down to blow the fuse beside the gun, and then seemed endeavoring to peer
      into the valley, where all was still and noiseless! As well as I could
      judge, our little party was nearest to the front; and although a small
      clump to the left of the road offered a safe shelter still nearer the
      enemy, I could not ascertain if it were occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word was now spoken. All save the corporal looked eagerly towards
      the enemy; he was watching for the signal, and knelt down with his drawn
      sword at his side. The deathlike stillness of the moment, so unlike the
      prelude to every movement in cavalry combat; the painful expectation which
      made minutes like years themselves; the small number of the party, so
      dissimilar to the closely crowded squadrons I was used to; but, more than
      all, the want of a horse,&mdash;that most stirring of all the excitements
      to heroism and daring,&mdash;unnerved me; and if my heart were to have
      been interrogated, I sadly fear it would have brought little corroboration
      to the song of the voltigeurs, which attributed so many features of
      superiority to their arm of the service above the rest of the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand and thousand times did I wish to be at the head of a cavalry
      charge up that narrow road in face of those guns; ay, though the mitraille
      should sweep the earth, there was that in the onward torrent of the
      horseman's course that left no room for fear. But this cold and stealthy
      approach, this weary watching, I could not bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, see,&rdquo; whispered the corporal, as he pointed with his finger towards
      the clump to the left of the road, &ldquo;how beautifully done! there goes
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, I could perceive the dark shadow of something moving close to
      the ground, and finally concealing itself in the brushwood, beneath which
      now above twenty men lay hid. At the same instant a deep rolling sound
      like far-off thunder was heard; and then louder still, but less deep in
      volume, the rattling crash of musketry. At first the discharges were more
      prolonged, and succeeded one another more rapidly; but gradually the
      firing became less regular; then after an interval swelled more fully
      again, and once more relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said the corporal; &ldquo;can't you hear the cheering? There again;
      the skirmishers are falling back,&mdash;the fire is too heavy for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, the Prussians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, the Prussians. Hark! there was a volley; that was no
      tirailleur discharge; the columns are advancing. Down, men, down!&rdquo;
       whispered he, as, excited by the sounds of musketry, some three or four
      popped up their heads to listen. At the same instant a noise in front drew
      our attention to that quarter; and we now saw that a party of horse
      artillerymen were descending the road with a light eight-pounder gun,
      which they were proceeding to place in position on a small knoll of ground
      about eighty yards from the coppice I have mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I could pick off that fellow on the gray horse,&rdquo; whispered a soldier
      beside me to his comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And bring the whole fire on us afterwards,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we be waiting for?&rdquo; said the corporal, impatiently. &ldquo;They are
      making that place as strong as a fortress; and there, see if that is not a
      reinforcement!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, the heavy tramp of men marching announced the approach of
      fresh troops; and by the bustle and noise within the farmhouse it was
      clear the preparations for its defence were making with all the activity
      the exigency demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past seven o'clock; but as the day broke more out, the heavy fog
      increased, and soon grew so dense as to shut out from our view the
      Prussian picket and the guns upon the road. Meanwhile the firing continued
      at a distance, but, as it seemed, fainter than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! there it comes now,&rdquo; said the corporal, as a shrill whistle was heard
      to our left. &ldquo;Look to your pieces, men! steady.&rdquo; There was a pause; every
      ear was bent to listen, every breath drawn short, when again he spoke.
      &ldquo;That 's it. <i>En avant</i>, lads! <i>en avant!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the word he sprang forward, but still crouching, he went as if the
      thick mist were not enough to conceal him. The men followed their leader
      with cautious steps, their carbines in hand and bayonets fixed. For some
      minutes we ascended the hill, gradually nearing the road, along which a
      low bank offered a slight protection against fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corporal halted here for a second or two, when another whistle, so
      faint as to be scarcely audible, was borne on the air. With a motion of
      his hand forwards he gave the order to advance, and led the way along the
      roadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we followed in single file, I found myself next the corporal, whose
      every motion I watched with an intensity of interest I cannot convey. At
      last he stopped and wheeled round; then, kneeling down, he levelled his
      piece upon the low bank,&mdash;a movement quickly followed by all the rest
      who in silence obeyed his signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly in front of us now, and as it seemed not above a dozen yards
      distant, the yellow glare of the artillery fuse could be dimly discerned
      through the mist; thither every eye was bent and every musket pointed.
      Thus we knelt with beating hearts, when suddenly several shots rang out
      from the valley and the opposite side of the road; as quickly replied to
      by the enemy, and a smart but irregular clattering of musketry followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried the corporal, aloud, &ldquo;now, and all together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then with one long, stunning report, every gun was discharged, and a
      wild cry of the wounded blended with the sounds as we cleared the fence
      and dashed at the guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down, men, down!&rdquo; called our leader, as we jumped into the road. The word
      was scarce uttered when a bright flash gleamed forth, a loud bang
      succeeded, and we heard the grapeshot crushing down the valley and tearing
      its way through the leaves and branches of the brushwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>En avant</i>, lads! now's your time!&rdquo; cried the corporal, as he sprang
      to his feet and led towards the gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one vigorous dash we pushed up the height, just as the cannoneers
      were preparing to load. The gunners fell back, and a party of infantry as
      quickly presented themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mist happily concealed the smallness of our force, otherwise the
      Prussians might have crushed us at once. For a second there was a pause;
      then both sides fired, an irregular volley was discharged, and the muskets
      were lowered to the charge. What must have been the fate of our little
      party now there could be no doubt; when suddenly, through the blue smoke
      which yet lingered near the guns, the bright gleaming of bayonets was seen
      to flash, while the loud <i>vivas</i> of our own soldiers rent the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      So rapid was the rush, and so thronging did they come, it seemed as if the
      very ground had given them up. With a cry of &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; on we went; the
      enemy retired and fell back behind the cover of the road, where they kept
      up a tremendous fire upon the gun, to which now all our efforts were
      directed, to turn against the walls of the farmhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mist by this was cleared away, and we were exposed to the shattering
      fire which was maintained not only along the road, but from every window
      and crevice in the walls of the farmhouse. Our men fell fast,&mdash;several
      badly wounded; for the distance was less than half musket-range, even to
      the farthest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bayonet, men! the bayonet! Leave the gun, and sweep the road of those
      fellows yonder!&rdquo; said the major, as, vaulting over the fence, he led the
      way himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were now reinforced, and numbered fully four companies; so that our
      attack soon drove in the enemy, who retreated, still firing, within the
      courtyard around the farmhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring up the gun, lads, and we 'll soon breach them,&rdquo; said the major.
      But, unhappily, the party to whom it was committed, being annoyed at the
      service which kept them back when their companions were advancing, had
      hurled the piece off its carriage, and rolled it down the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a muttered <i>sacré</i> on their stupidity, the officer cried out to
      scale the walls. If honor and rank and wealth had lain on the opposite
      side, and not death and agony, they could not have obeyed with more
      alacrity. Raised on one another's shoulders, the brave fellows mounted the
      wall; but it was only to fall back again into their comrades' arms, dead
      or mortally wounded. Still they pressed on: a reckless defiance of danger
      had shut out every other thought; and their cheers grew wilder and fiercer
      as the fire told upon them, while the shouts of triumph from those within
      stimulated them to the verge of madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back, men! stand back!&rdquo; called the major; &ldquo;down! I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, a dead silence followed; the men retreated behind the cover
      of the fence, and lay down flat with their faces to the ground. A low,
      hissing noise was then heard; and then, with a clap like thunder, the
      strong gate was rent into fragments and scattered in blazing pieces about
      the field. The crash of the petard was answered by a cheer wild as a
      war-whoop, and onward the infuriated soldiers poured through the still
      burning timbers. And now began a scene of carnage which only a
      hand-to-hand encounter can ever produce. From every door and window the
      Prussians maintained a deadly fire: but the onward tide of victory was
      with us, and we poured down upon them with the bayonet; and as none gave,
      none asked for, quarter, the work of death was speedy. To the wild shouts
      of battle, the crash, the din, the tumult of the fight, a dropping
      irregular fire succeeded; and then came the low, wailing cries of the
      wounded, the groans of the dying, and all was over! We were the victors;
      but what a victory! The garden was strewn with our dead; the hall, the
      stairs, every room was covered with bodies of our brave fellows, their
      rugged faces even sterner than in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes it seemed as though our emotions had unnerved us all, as
      we stood speechless, gazing on the fearful scene of bloodshed; when the
      low rolling of drums, heard from the mountain side, startled every
      listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prussians! the Prussians!&rdquo; called out three or four voices together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; shouted François; &ldquo;I was too long a tambour not to know that
      beat; they 're our fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The drums rolled fuller and louder; and soon the head of a column appeared
      peering over the ascent of the road. The sun shone brightly on their gay
      uniforms and glancing arms, and the tall and showily-dressed tambour-major
      stepped in advance with the proud bearing of a conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Form, men, and to the front!&rdquo; said the major of the voltigeurs, who knew
      that his place was in the advance, and felt a noble pride that he had won
      it bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the column came up the road, the voltigeurs, scattered along the road
      on either side, advanced at a run. But no longer was there any obstacle to
      their course; no enemy presented themselves in sight, and we mounted the
      ascent without a single shot being fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I stopped for time to recover breath, I could not help turning to
      behold the valley, which, now filled with armed men, was a grand and a
      gorgeous sight. In long columns of attack they came, the artillery filling
      the interspaces between them. A brilliant sunlight shone out; and I could
      distinguish the different brigades, with whose colors I was now familiar.
      Still my eye ranged over the field in search of cavalry, the arm I loved
      above all others,&mdash;that which, more than all the rest, revived the
      heroic spirit of the chivalrous ages, and made the horseman feel the
      ancient ardor of the belted knight. But none were within sight. Indeed,
      the very nature of the ground offered an obstacle to their movement, and I
      saw that here, as at Austerlitz, the day was for the infantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile we toiled up the height, and at length reached the crest of the
      ridge. And then burst forth a sight such as all the grandeur I had ever
      beheld of war had never presented the equal to. On a vast tableland,
      slightly undulating on the surface, was drawn up the whole Prussian army
      in battle array,&mdash;a splendid force of nigh thirty thousand infantry,
      flanked by ten thousand sabres, the finest cavalry in Europe. By some
      inconceivable error of tactics, they had offered no other resistance to
      the French ascent of the mountain than the skirmishing troops, which fell
      back as we came on; and even now they seemed to wait patiently for the
      enemy to form before the conflict should begin. As our columns crowned the
      hill they instantly deployed, to cover the advance of those who followed:
      but the precaution seemed needless; for, except at the extreme left, where
      we heard the firing before, the Prussian army never moved a man, nor
      showed any disposition to attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now nine o'clock; the sky clear and cloudless, and a bright
      autumnal day permitted the eye to range for miles on every side. The
      Prussian army, but forty thousand strong, was drawn up in the form of an
      arch, presenting the convexity to our front; while our troops, ninety
      thousand in number, overlapped them on either flank, and extended far
      beyond them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle began by the advance of the French columns and the retreat of
      the enemy,&mdash;both movements being accomplished without a shot being
      fired, and the whole seeming the manoeuvres of a field-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, as the Prussians took up the position they intended to hold,
      their guns were seen moving to the front; squadrons of cavalry disengaged
      themselves from behind the infantry masses; and then a tremendous tire
      opened from the whole line. Our troops advanced <i>en tirailleurs</i>,&mdash;that
      is, whole regiments thrown out in skirmishing order,&mdash;which, when
      pressed, fell back, and permitted the columns to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The division to which I found myself attached received orders to move
      obliquely across the plain, in the direction of some cottages, which I
      soon heard was the village of Vierzehn Heiligen, and the centre of the
      Prussian position. A galling fire of artillery played upon the column as
      it went; and before we accomplished half the distance, our loss was
      considerable. More than once, too, the cry of &ldquo;cavalry!&rdquo; was heard; and
      quick as the warning itself, we were thrown into square, to receive the
      impetuous horsemen, who came madly on to the charge. Ney himself stood in
      the squares, animating the men by his presence, and cheering them at every
      volley they poured in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonder, men! yonder is the centre of their position,&rdquo; said he, pointing
      to the village, which now bristled with armed men, several guns upon a
      height beyond it commanding the approach, and a cloud of cavalry hovering
      near, to pounce down upon those who might be daring enough to assail it. A
      wild cheer answered his words: both general and soldiers understood each
      other well.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two columns of attack the division was formed; and then the word
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; was given. &ldquo;Orderly time, men!&rdquo; said General Dorsenne, who
      commanded that with which I was; and, obedient to the order, the ranks
      moved as if on parade.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now let me mention a circumstance, which, though trivial in itself,
      presents a feature of the peculiar character of courage which
      distinguished the French officer in battle. As the line advanced, the fire
      of the Prussian battery, which by this had found out our range most
      accurately, opened severely on us, but more particularly on the left; and
      as the men fell fast, and the grapeshot tore through the ranks, a wavering
      of the line took place, and in several places a broken front was
      presented. Dorsenne saw it at once, and placing himself in front of the
      advance, with his back towards the enemy, he called out, as if on parade,
      &ldquo;Close order&mdash;close order! Move up there&mdash;left, right&mdash;left,
      right!&rdquo; And so did he retire step by step, marking the time with his
      sword, while the shot flew past and about him, and the earth was scattered
      by the torrent of the grapeshot. Courage like this would seem to give a
      charmed life, for while death was dealing fast around him, he never
      received a wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village was attacked at the bayonet point, and at the charge the enemy
      received us. So long as their artillery could continue its fire, our loss
      was fearful; but once within shelter of the walls and close in with the
      Prussian ranks, the firing ceased, and the struggle was hand to hand.
      Twice did we win our way up the ascent; twice were we beaten back. Strong
      reinforcements were coming up to the enemy's aid; when a loud rolling of
      the drums and a hoarse cheer from behind revived our spirits,&mdash;it was
      Lannes's division advancing at a run. They opened to permit our retiring
      masses to re-form behind them, and then rushed on. A crash of musketry
      rang out, and through the smoke the glancing bayonets flashed and the red
      flame danced wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;En avant! en avant!&rdquo; burst from every man, as, maddened with excitement,
      we plunged into the fray. Like a vast torrent tumbling from some mountain
      gorge, the column poured on, overwhelming all before it,&mdash;now
      struggling for a moment, as some obstacle delayed, but could not arrest,
      its march; now rushing headlong, it swept along. The village was won; the
      Prussians fell back. Their guns opened fiercely on us, and cavalry tore
      past, sabring all who sought not shelter within the walls: but the post
      was ours, the key of their position was in our hands; and Ney sent three
      messengers one after the other to the Emperor to let him know the result,
      and enable him to push forward and attack the Prussian centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a wild cry was heard from the little street of the village: the
      houses were in flames. The Prussians had thrown in heated shells, and the
      wooden roofs of the cottages caught up the fire. For an instant all
      became, as it were, panic-struck, and a confused movement of retreat was
      begun: but the next moment order was restored; the sappers scaled the
      walls of the burning houses, and with their axes severed the timbers, and
      suffered the blazing mass to fall within the buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by this time the Prussians had re-formed their columns, and once more
      advanced to the attack. The moment was in their favor: the disorder of our
      ranks, and the sudden fear inspired by an unlooked-for danger still
      continued, when they came on. Then, indeed, began a scene of bloodshed the
      most horrible to witness: through the narrow streets, within the gardens,
      the houses themselves, the combatants fought hand to hand; neither would
      give way; neither knew on which side lay their supporting columns. It was
      the terrible carnage of deadly animosity on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the flames burst forth anew, and amid the crackling of the
      burning timbers and the dense smoke of the lighted thatch, the fight went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vandamme! Vandamme!&rdquo; cried several voices, in ecstasy; &ldquo;here come the
      grenadiers!&rdquo; And, true enough, the tall shakos peered through the blue
      cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah for the Faubourg!&rdquo; shouted a wild voltigeur, as he waved his cap
      and sprang forward. &ldquo;Let us not lose the glory now, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appeal was not made in vain. From every window and doorway the men
      leaped down into the street, and rushed at the Prussian column, which was
      advancing at the charge. Suddenly the column opened, a rushing sound was
      heard, and down with the speed of lightning rode a squadron of
      cuirassiers. Over us they tore, sabring as they went, nor halted till the
      head of Vandamme's column poured in a volley. Then wheeling, they galloped
      back, trampling on our wounded, and dealing death with their broadswords.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, a sabre-cut in the head had stunned me; and while I leaned for
      support against the wall of a house, a horseman tore past, and with one
      vigorous cut he cleft open my shoulder. I staggered back and fell, covered
      with bloody upon the door-sill. I saw our column pass on, cheering, and
      heard the wild cry, &ldquo;En avant I en avant!&rdquo; swelling from a thousand
      voices; and then, faint and exhausted, my senses reeled, and the rest was
      like an indistinct dream.

      CHAPTER XXIV. A FRAGMENT OF A MAÎTRE d'ARMES EXPERIENCES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Stunned, and like one but half awake, I followed the tide of marching men
      which swept past like a mighty river, the roar of the artillery and the
      crash of battle increasing the confusion of my brain. All distinct memory
      of the remainder of the day is lost to me. I can recollect the explosion
      of several wagons of the ammunition train, and how the splinters wounded
      several of those around me; I also have a vague, dreamy sense of being
      hurried along at intervals, and then seeing masses of cavalry dash past.
      But the great prevailing thought above all others is, of leaning over the
      edge of a charrette, where I lay with some wounded soldiers, to watch the
      retreat of the Prussians, as they were pursued by Murat's cavalry.
      François was at my side, and described to me the great events of the
      battle; but though I seemed to listen, the sounds fell unregarded on my
      ear. Even now, it seems to me like a dream; and the only palpable idea
      before me is the heated air, the dark and lowering sky, And the deafening
      thunder of the guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well known how the victory of Jena was crowned by the glorious issue
      of the battle of Auerstadt, where the main body of the Prussians, under
      the command of the king himself, was completely beaten by Davoust with a
      force not half their number. The two routed armies crossed in their
      flight, while the headlong fury of the French cavalry pressed down on
      them; nor did the terrible slaughter cease till night gave respite to the
      beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The victors and the vanquished entered Weimar together, a distance of full
      six leagues from the field of battle. All struggle had long ceased. An
      unresisting massacre it was; and such was the disappointment and anger of
      the people of the country, that the Prussian officers were frequently
      attacked and slain by the peasantry, whose passionate indignation made
      them suspect treachery in the result of the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      All whose wounds were but slight, and whose health promised speedy
      restoration, were mounted into wagons taken from the enemy, and sent
      forward with the army. Among this number I found myself, and that same
      night slept soundly and peacefully in the straw of the charrette in which
      I travelled from Jena.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor's headquarters were established at Weimar, and thither all the
      ambulances were conveyed; while the marshals, with their several
      divisions, were sent in pursuit of the enemy. As for myself, before the
      week elapsed, I was sufficiently recovered to move about; for happily the
      stunning effects which immediately followed the injury were its worst
      consequences, and my wound in the shoulder proved but trifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you are determined to join the cavalry again?&rdquo; said François, as
      he sat by my side under a tree, where a cheerful fire of blazing wood had
      drawn several to enjoy its comfort. &ldquo;That is what I cannot comprehend by
      any stretch of ingenuity,&mdash;how a man who has once seen something of
      voltigeur life can go back to the dull routine of dragoon service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have had enough of skirmishing, François,&rdquo; said I, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it of that knock on the pate you speak?&rdquo; said he, contemptuously.
      &ldquo;Bah! the heavy shako you wear would give a worse headache. Come, come;
      think better on 't. I can tell you&rdquo;&mdash;here he lowered his voice to a
      whisper&mdash;&ldquo;I can tell you, Burke, the major noticed the manner you
      held your ground in the old farmhouse. I heard him refuse to send a
      reinforcement when the Prussians made their second attack. 'No, no,' said
      he; 'that hussar fellow yonder does his work so well, he wants no help
      from us.' When he said that, my friend, be assured your promotion is safe
      enough. You were made for a voltigeur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, François, it's no use; all your flattery won't make me desert. I
      'll try and join my brigade to-morrow; that is, if I can find them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never told me in what way you first became separated from your corps.
      How was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something of a secret there, François; you mustn't ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I understand,&rdquo; said he, with a knowing look, and a gesture of his
      hand, as if making a pass with his sword. &ldquo;Did you kill him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not exactly,&rdquo; said I, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely gave him that pretty lunge <i>en tierce</i> you favored me with,&rdquo;
       said he, putting his hand on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor even that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Diable!</i> then how was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you it was a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secret! Confound it, man, there are no secrets in a campaign, except when
      the military chest is empty or the commissary falls short of grub; these
      are the only things one ever thinks of hushing up. Come, out with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it must be, I may as well have the benefit of your advice. So
      draw closer, for I don't wish the rest to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In as few words as I was able, I explained to François the circumstances
      of the night march, and the manner of my meeting with the Emperor at the
      ravine, where the artillery train was stopped. But when I came to the
      incident of the picket, and mentioned how, in rescuing the Emperor, my
      horse had been killed under me, he could no longer restrain himself, but
      turned to the rest, who, to the number of fifteen or sixteen, sat around
      the fire, and burst forth,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mille tonnerres!</i> but the boy is a fool!&rdquo; And then, before I could
      interpose a word, blurted out the whole adventure to the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no use now to attempt any concealment at all; neither was there
      to feel anger at his conduct. One would have been as absurd as the other;
      and so I had to endure, as best I could, the various comments that were
      passed on my behavior, on the prudence of which certainly no second
      opinion existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be right certain of promotion, Captain,&rdquo; said an old sergeant,
      with a gray beard and mustache, &ldquo;or you wouldn't refuse such a chance as
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Diable!</i>&rdquo; cried François; &ldquo;don't you see he wouldn't accept of it.
      He is too proud to wait on the Petit Caporal, though he asked him to do
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 'd have given you the cross of the Legion anyhow,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, by Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed the riding-master of a dragoon regiment, &ldquo;and
      sent him a remount from his own stud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think that modesty!&rdquo; said Francois, whose indignation at my folly
      knew no bounds. &ldquo;<i>Par Saint Joseph!</i> if I'd been as modest, it's not
      maître d'armes of a voltigeur battalion I 'd be to-day; though I may say,
      without boasting, I'm not afraid to cross a rapier with any man in the
      army. No, no; that's not the way I managed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that, Maître Francois?&rdquo; said a young officer, who felt curious to
      learn the circumstance to which he seemed to attach a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the honorable society cares to hear it,&rdquo; said François, uncovering,
      and bowing courteously to all around, &ldquo;I shall have great pleasure in
      recounting a little incident of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A general cry of acclamation and &ldquo;bravo&rdquo; met the polite proposal; while
      Francois, accepting a <i>goutte</i> from a canteen presented to him, began
      thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I began my soldier's life at the first step of the ladder. I was a
      drummer-boy at Jemappes; and, when I grew old enough to exchange the
      drumstick for the sword, I was attached to the <i>chasseurs à cheval</i>,
      and went with them to Egypt. I could tell you some strange stories of our
      doings there,&mdash;I don't mean with the Turks, mark you, but amongst
      ourselves,&mdash;for we had little affairs with the sword almost every
      day; and I soon showed them I was their master. But that is not to the
      purpose; what I am about to speak of happened in this wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At break of day, one morning, the picket to which I was joined received
      orders to mount, and accompany the general along the bank of the Nile to
      the village of Chebrheis, where we heard that a Mameluke force were
      assembling, whose strength and equipment it was important to ascertain.
      Our horses were far from fresh when we started; the day previous had been
      spent in a fatiguing march from Rhemanieh, crossing a dreary desert, with
      hot sands and no water. But General Bonaparte always expected us to turn
      out, as if we had got a general remount; and so we made the best of it,
      and set out in as good style as we could. We had not gone above a league
      and a half, however, when we found that the slapping pace of the general
      had left the greater part of the escort out of sight; and of a score of
      four squadrons, not above twenty horsemen were present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Emperor&mdash;you know he was only general then, but it 's all the
      same&mdash;laughed heartily when he found he had outridden the rest;
      indeed, for that matter, he laughed at our poor blown beasts, that shook
      on every limb, and seemed like to push their spare, gaunt bones through
      the trappings with which, for shame's sake, we endeavored to cover them.
      But his joke was but shortlived; for just then, from behind the wall of an
      old ruined temple&mdash;whiz!&mdash;there came a shattering volley of
      musketry in the midst of us; the only miracle is how one escaped. The next
      moment there was a wild hurrah, and we beheld some fifty Mameluke fellows,
      all glittering with gold, coming down full speed on us, on their Arab
      chargers. <i>Mille cadavres!</i> what was to be done? Nothing, you'd say,
      but run for it. And so we should have done, if the beasts were able: but
      not a bit of it; they couldn't have raised a gallop if Mourad Bey had been
      there with his whole army. And so we put a good face on it, and drew up
      across the way, and looked as if going to charge. Egad! the Turks were
      amazed. They halted up short, and stared about them to see what infantry
      or artillery there might be coming up to our assistance, so boldly did we
      hold our ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We'll keep them in check, General,' said the officer of the picket.
      'Lose no time now, but make a dash for it, and you'll get away.' And so,
      without more ado, Bonaparte turned his horse's head round, and, driving
      his spurs into him, set out at top speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was the signal for the Mameluke charge; and down they came. <i>Sacristi!</i>
      how the infidels rode us down! Over and over our fellows rolled, men and
      horses together, while they slashed with their keen cimeters on every
      side; few needed a second cut, I warrant you.
    </p>
    <p>

      <img src="images/296.jpg" alt="296 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By some good fortune, my beast kept his legs in the <i>mêlée</i>, and,
      with even better luck, got so frightened that he started off, and struck
      out in full gallop after the general, who, about two hundred paces in
      front of me, was dashing along, pursued by a Mameluke, with a cimeter held
      over his head. The Turk's horse, however, was wounded, and could not gain
      even on the tired animal before him, while mine was at every stride
      overtaking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Mameluke, hearing the clatter behind, turned his head. I seized the
      moment, and discharged my only remaining pistol at him,&mdash;alas!
      without effect. With a wild war-cry the fellow swerved round and came down
      upon me, intending to take my horse in flank, and hurl me over. But the
      good beast plunged forward, and my enemy passed behind, and only grazed
      the haunches as he went; the moment after he was at my side. <i>Parbleu!</i>
      I did n't like the companionship. I knew every turn of a broadsword or a
      rapier well; but a curved cimeter, keen as a razor, of Damascus steel,
      glittering and glistening over my head, was a different thing: the great
      dark eyes of the fellow, too, glared like balls of fire, and his white
      teeth were clenched. With a swing of his blade over his head, so loosely
      done I thought he had almost flung the weapon from his hand, he aimed a
      cut at my neck; but, quick as lightning, I dropped upon the mane, and the
      sharp blade shaved the red feather from my shako, and sent it floating in
      the air, while, with a straight point, I ran him through the body, and
      heard his death-shout as he fell bathed in blood upon the sands. The
      general saw him fall, and cried out something; but I could not hear the
      words, nor, to say truth, did I care much at the time: my happiest thought
      just then was to see the remainder of the escort, which we had left
      behind, coming up at a smart canter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Turks no sooner perceived them than they wheeled and fled; and so we
      returned to the camp, with a loss of some twenty brave fellows, and none
      the wiser for all our trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What shall I do for you, friend?' said the general to me, as I stood by
      his orders at the door of his tent, 'what shall I do for you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> said I, with a shrug of my shoulders, 'I can't well say at
      a moment; perhaps the best thing would be to promise you 'd never take me
      as one of your escort when you make such an expedition as this morning's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, no, I 'll not say that. Who are you? What's your grade?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'François, maître d'armes of the Fourth Chasseurs of the Guard,' said I,
      proudly. And, indeed, I thought he might have known me without the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah, indeed!' replied he, gravely. 'Promotion is then of no use here; a
      maître d'armes, like a general of division, is at the top of the tree.
      Come, I have it; a fellow of your sort is never out of scrapes,&mdash;always
      duelling and quarrelling, under arrest three days in every week; I know
      you well. Now, Maître François, I 'll forgive you the first time you ask
      me for any offence within my power to pardon. Go; you are satisfied with
      that promise,&mdash;is it not so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, General; and I'll soon jog your memory about it,' said I, saluting
      and retiring from the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see some old 'braves' of the Pyramids about me now,&rdquo; continued
      François, &ldquo;and so I need not dwell on the events of the campaign. You all
      know how General Bonaparte left the army to Kléber, and went back to
      France; and somehow we never had much luck after that. But so it was, I
      came back with the regiment, and was at the battle of Marengo when our
      brigade captured four guns of Skal's battery, and carried off eleven of
      their officers our prisoners. You'd wonder now, Comrades, how that piece
      of good fortune should turn out so ill for me; but such was the case.
      After the battle was gained, General Bonaparte retired to Gerofola with
      his staff, and I was ordered to proceed after him, with the Hauptmann
      Klingenswert of the Austrian army,&mdash;one of our prisoners who had
      served on Melas's staff, and knew everything about the effective strength
      of the army and all their plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We set off at daybreak. It was in June, and a lovely morning too; and as
      my prisoner was an officer and a man of honor, I took no escort, but rode
      along at his side. We halted at noon to dine in a little grove of cedars,
      where I opened my canteen and spread the contents on the grass: and after
      regaling ourselves pleasantly, we lighted our meerschaums and chatted away
      like old comrades over the war and its chances. A more agreeable fellow
      than the Austrian I never met. He told me his whole history, and I told
      him mine; and we drank Brüderschaft together, and swore I don't know how
      many eternal friendships. The devil was just amusing himself with us all
      this time though, as you 'll see presently; for we soon got into an
      argument about the charge in which our brigade captured the guns. He said
      that if the ammunition had not failed we never would have dared the
      attack; and I swore that the discharges were pouring in while we rode down
      on the battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We grew warm with the dispute, and drank deeper to cool us; and, what
      between the wine and our own passion, we became downright angry, and went
      so far as to interchange something not like Brüderschaft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah, how unfortunate I always am!' said I, sighing. 'If I had only the
      good luck to be the prisoner now, and you the escort&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What then?' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How easily, and how pleasantly too, could we settle this little affair.
      The ground is smooth as velvet; there is no sun; all still, and quiet, and
      peaceful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, no,' said the Austrian; 'I couldn't do what you propose,&mdash;I
      should be dishonored forever if I took such an advantage of you. You must
      know, François,' for he called me so, recurring at once to his tone of
      kindliness, 'I am the first swordsman of my brigade.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could scarcely avoid throwing myself into his arms as he spoke; never
      was there such a piece of fortune. 'And I,' cried I, in ecstasy, 'I the
      first of the whole French army!' You know, Comrades, I only said that <i>en
      gascon</i>, and to afford him the greater pleasure in our <i>rencontre</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We soon measured our swords and threw off our jackets. 'François,' said
      he, 'I ought to mention to you that my lunge <i>en tierce</i> is my famous
      stroke; I rarely miss running my adversary through the chest with it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I know the trick well,' said I; 'take care of my &ldquo;pass&rdquo; outside the
      guard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh! if that's your game,' said he, laughing, 'I'll make short work of
      it. Now, to begin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'All ready,' said I; 'en garde!' And we crossed our weapons. For a German
      he was a capital swordsman, and had a very pretty trick of putting in his
      point over the hilt, and wounding the sword-arm; but if it had not been
      for all the wine I drank the affair would have been over in a second or
      two. As it was, we both fenced loose, and without any judgment whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah! you got that,' said I, 'at last!' as I pierced him in the back,
      outside the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, no!' cried he, passionately; for his temper was up, and he would not
      confess a touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, then, that's home!' said I, thrusting beneath his hilt, till the
      blood spurted out along my blade and even in my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, that's home,' said he, staggering back, while one of his legs
      crossed over the other, and he fell heavily on the grass. I stooped down
      to feel his heart; and as I did so my senses failed, my limbs tottered,
      and I rolled headlong over him. Truth was, I was badly wounded, though I
      never knew when; for his sword had entered my chest, beneath a rib, and
      cut some large vessels in the lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end of it all was, the Austrian was buried, and I was broke the
      service without pay or pension, my wound being declared by the doctors an
      incapacity to serve in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comrades, we often hear men talk of the happy day before them when they
      shall leave the army and throw off the knapsack, and give up the musket
      for the mattock. Well, trust me, it's no such pleasure as they deem it,
      after all. There was I, turned loose upon the world, with nothing but a
      suit of ragged clothes my comrades made up amongst them, my old rapier,
      and a bad asthma. Such was my stock-in-trade, to begin life anew, at the
      age of forty-seven. And so, I set out on my weary way back to Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you try your chance with the Petit Caporal first?&rdquo; asked one of
      the listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I did. I sent him a long petition, setting forth the whole
      circumstance, and detailing every minute particular of the duel; but I
      received it back, unopened,&mdash;with Duroc's name, and the word
      'Rejected,' on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange-how unfit we old soldiers are for any occupation in a civil
      way, when we 've spent half a lifetime campaigning. When I reached Paris,
      I could almost have wedged myself into the scabbard of my sword. Long
      marches and short rations had told heavily on me; and the custom-house
      officer at the barrier told me to pass on, without ever stopping to see
      that I carried no contraband goods about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a miserable time enough of it for twelve or fourteen months. The
      only way of support I could find was teaching recruits the sword exercise;
      and you know they could n't be very liberal in their rewards for the
      service. But even this poor trade was soon interdicted, as the police
      reported that I encouraged the young soldiers to fight duels,&mdash;a
      great offence, truly! But you see everything went unluckily with me at
      that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was to become of me now I couldn't tell; when an old comrade,
      pensioned off from Moreau's army, had interest to get me appointed
      supernumerary, as they call it, in the Grand Opera, where I used to
      perform as a Roman soldier, or a friar, or a peasant, or some such thing,
      for five francs a week. Not a sou more had I, and the duty was heavier
      than on active service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After two years, the 'big drum' died of a rheumatic fever, from beating a
      great solo in a new German Opera, and I was promoted to his place; for by
      this time I was quite recovered from the effects of my wound, and could
      use my arms as well as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the honorable company may remember the first night that Napoleon
      visited the Grand Opera after he was named Emperor. It was a glorious
      sight, and one can never forget it. The whole house was filled with
      generals and field-marshals: it was a grand field-day, by the glare of ten
      thousand wax-lights. And the Empress was there, and her whole suite, and
      all the prettiest women in France. Little time had I to look at them,
      though; for there was I, in the corner of the orchestra, with my big drum
      before me, on which I was to play the confounded thing that killed the
      other fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a strange performance, sure enough: for in the midst of a great
      din and crash, came a dead pause; and then I was to strike three solemn
      bangs on the drum,&mdash;to be followed by a succession of blows, fast as
      lightning, for five minutes. This was the composer's notion of a battle,&mdash;distant
      firing! Heaven bless his heart! I was wishing he 'd seen some of it. This
      was to come on in the second act, up to which time I had nothing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do I say nothing? I had to gaze at the Petit Caporal, who sat there
      in the box over my head, looking as stern and as thoughtful as ever, and
      not minding much what the Empress said, though she kept prattling into his
      ear all the time, and trying to attract his attention. <i>Parbleu!</i> he
      was not thinking of all the nonsense before him,&mdash;his mind was on
      real battles: he had seen real smoke,&mdash;that he had! He was fatter and
      paler than he used to be; and I thought, too, his frown was darker than
      when I saw him last: but, to be sure, that was at Marengo, and he ever
      looked pleased on the field of battle. I could n't take my eyes from him:
      his fine thoughtful face, so full of determination and energy, reminded me
      of my old days of campaigning. I thought of Areola and Rivoli, of Cairo
      and the Pyramids, and the great charge at Marengo when Desaix's division
      came up,&mdash;and my heart was nigh bursting when I remembered that I
      wore the epaulette no longer. I forgot, too, where I was; and expected
      every instant to hear him call for one of the marshals, or see him stretch
      out his hand to point to a distant part of the field. And so absorbed was
      I in my reveries, that I had neither eyes nor ears for anything around me;
      when suddenly all the din of the orchestra ceased,&mdash;not a sound was
      heard; and a hand rudely shook me by the arm, while a voice whispered,
      'Now! now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0015" id="linkimage-0015">

      <img src="images/302.jpg" alt="302 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mechanically I seized the drumsticks. But my eyes still were riveted in
      the Emperor,&mdash;my whole heart and soul were centred in him. Again the
      voice called to me to begin; and a low murmur of angry meaning ran through
      the orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sprang to my legs, and in the excitement of the moment, losing all
      memory of time and place, I rolled out the <i>pas de charge!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarce had the first <i>roulade</i> of the well-known sounds reverberated
      through the house, when one cry of 'Vive l'Empereur!' burst forth. It was
      not a cheer; it was the heart-given outbreak of ten thousand devoted
      followers. Marshals, generals, colonels, ambassadors, ministers, all
      joined; and the vast assembly rocked to and fro like the sea in a storm,
      while Napoleon himself, slowly rising, bent his proud head in
      acknowledgment, and then sat down again amid the thundering shouts of
      acclamation. It was full twenty minutes before the piece could proceed;
      and even then momentary outbreaks of enthusiasm would occur to interrupt
      it, and continued to burst forth till the curtain fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just then an aide-de-camp appeared beside the orchestra, and ordered me
      to the Emperor's box. <i>Satristi!</i>how I trembled! I did n't know what
      might come of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah, <i>coquin!</i> said he, as I stood ready to drop with fear at the
      door of the box, 'this has been one of thy doings, eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, Sire,' muttered I in a half whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And how hast thou dared to spoil an opera in this fashion?' said he,
      frowning fiercely. 'Answer me, sirrah!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It was your Majesty's fault,' said I, becoming reckless of all
      consequences. 'You did n't seem to care much for all their scraping and
      blowing, and so I thought the old <i>roulade</i> might raise you a bit.
      You used to like it once; and might still, if the times be not altered.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And they are not,' said he, sternly. 'Who art thou, that seem'st to know
      me thus well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Old François, that was maître d'armes of the Fourth in Egypt, and who
      saved you from the stroke of a Mameluke sabre at Chebrheis.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What! the fellow who killed an Austrian prisoner after Marengo? Why, I
      thought thee dead.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Better for me I had been!' said I. 'You would n't read my petition.
      ('Yes, you may frown away, General,' said I to Duroc, who kept glowering
      at me like a tiger.) I began life at the tambour; I have come down to it
      again. You can't bring me lower, <i>parbleu!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Emperor whispered something to the Empress, who turned round towards
      me and laughed; and then he made a sign for me to withdraw. Before I had
      got a dozen paces from the box, an aide-de-camp overtook me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'François,' said he, 'you are to appear before the medical commission
      to-morrow; and if their report be favorable, you are to have your old
      grade of maître d'armes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it was. Not only was I restored, but they even placed me in the
      same regiment I served in during the campaigns of Egypt and Italy. The
      corps, however, was greatly changed since I knew it before; and so I asked
      the Emperor to appoint me to a voltigeur battalion, where discipline is
      not so rigid, and pleasant comrades are somewhat more plentiful. I had my
      wish, gentlemen. And now, with your permission, we'll drink the 'Faubourg
      St. Antoine,' the cradle of our arm of the service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In repeating Maître Francois's tale, I could only wish it might have one
      half the success with my reader it met with from his comrades of the
      bivouac. This, however, I cannot look for, and must leave it and him to
      their fortunes, and now turn to follow the course of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      François was not the only one who felt surprised at my being able to
      resist the pleasures of a voltigeurs life; and my companion the corporal
      looked upon my determination to join the hussar brigade as one of those
      extraordinary instances of duty predominating over inclination. &ldquo;Not,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;but there may be brave fellows and good soldiers among the
      dragoons; though having a horse to ride is a sore drawback on a man's
      courage. And when one has felt the confidence of standing face to face,
      and foot to foot, with the enemy, I cannot see how he can ever bring
      himself to fight in any other fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man can accustom himself to anything, Corporal,&rdquo; said an old,
      hardy-looking soldier, who sat smoking with the most profound air of
      thoughtful reflection. &ldquo;I remember being in the 'dromedary brigade' at
      Cairo. Few of us could keep our seats at first; and when we fell off, it
      was often hard enough to resist the Mamelukes and hold the beasts besides;
      but even that we learned with time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This explanation, little flattering as it was to the cavalry, seemed to
      convince the listeners that time, which smoothes so many difficulties,
      will even make a man content to be a dragoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since you will not be 'of ours,'&rdquo; said François, &ldquo;let us drink a
      parting cup, and say good-by, for I hear the bugle sounding the call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A health to the 'Faubourg St. Antoine,' boys!&rdquo; cried I, and a hearty
      cheer re-echoed the toast; and with many a shake-hands, and many a promise
      of welcome whenever I saw the error of my ways sufficiently to doff the
      dolman for the voltigeur's jacket, I took leave of the gallant
      Twenty-second, and set out towards Weimar.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. BERLIN AFTER &ldquo;JENA.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      As the battle of Austerlitz was the deathblow to the empire of Austria, so
      with the defeat at Jena did Prussia fall, and that great kingdom became a
      prey to the conquering Napoleon. Were this a fitting place, it might be
      curious to inquire into the causes which involved a ruin so sudden and so
      complete; and how a vast and highly organized army seemed at one fell
      stroke annihilated and destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The victories of Jena and Auerstadt, great and decisive as they were, were
      nevertheless inadequate to such results; and if the genius of the Emperor
      had not been as prompt to follow up as to gain a battle, they never would
      have occurred. But scarcely had the terrible contest ceased, when he sent
      for the Saxon officers who were taken prisoners, and addressing them in a
      tone of kindness, declared at once that they were at liberty and might
      return to their homes, first pledging their words not to carry arms
      against France or her allies. One hundred and twenty officers of different
      grades, from lieutenant-general downwards, gave this promise and retired
      to their own country, extolling the generosity of Napoleon. This first
      step was soon followed up by another and more important one; negotiations
      were opened with the Elector of Saxony, and the title of king offered to
      him on condition of his joining the Confederacy of the Rhine; and thus
      once more the artful policy already pursued with regard to Bavaria in the
      south, was here renewed in the north of Germany, and with equal success.
    </p>
    <p>
      This deep-laid scheme deprived the Prussian army of eighteen thousand men,
      and that on the very moment when defeat and disaster had spread their
      demoralizing influences through the entire army. Several of their greatest
      generals were killed, many more dreadfully or fatally wounded: Prince
      Louis, Ruchel, Schmettau, among the former; the Duke of Brunswick and
      Prince Henry both severely wounded. The Duke survived but a few days, and
      these in the greatest suffering; Marshal Möllendorf, the veteran of nigh
      eighty years, had his chest pierced by a lance. Here was misfortune enough
      to cause dismay and despair; for unhappily the nation itself was but an
      army in feeling and organization, and with defeat every hope died out and
      every arm was paralyzed. The patriotism of the people had taken its place
      beneath a standard, which when once lowered before a conqueror, nothing
      more remained. Such is the destiny of a military monarchy: its only
      vitality is victory; the hour of disaster is its deathblow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system of a whole corps capitulating, which the Prussians had not
      scrupled to sneer at when occurring in Austria, now took place here with
      even greater rapidity. Scarcely a day passed that some regiment did not
      lay down their arms, and surrender <i>sur parole</i>. A panic spread
      through the whole length and breadth of the land; places of undoubted
      strength were surrendered as insecure and untenable. No rest nor respite
      was allowed the vanquished: the gay plumes of the lancers fluttered over
      the vast plains in pursuit; columns of infantry poured in every direction
      through the kingdom; and the eagles glittered in every town and every
      village of conquered Prussia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never did the spirit of Napoleon display itself more pitiless than in this
      campaign; for while in his every act he evinced a determination to break
      down and destroy the nation, the &ldquo;Moniteur&rdquo; at Paris teemed with articles
      in derision of the army whose bravery he should never have questioned.
      Even the gallant leaders themselves&mdash;old and scarred warriors&mdash;were
      contemptuously described as blind and infatuated fanatics, undeserving of
      clemency or consideration. Not thus should he have spoken of the noble
      Prince Louis and the brave Duke of Brunswick; they fought in a good cause,
      and they met the death of gallant soldiers. &ldquo;I will make their nobles beg
      their bread upon the highways!&rdquo; was the dreadful sentence he uttered at
      Weimar. And the words were never forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conduct and bearing of the Emperor was the more insulting from its
      contrast with that of his marshals and generals, many of whom could not
      help acknowledging in their acts the devotion and patriotism of their
      vanquished foes. Murat lost no occasion to evince this feeling; and sent
      eight colonels of his own division to carry the pall at General
      Schmettau's funeral, who was interred with all the honors due to one who
      had been the companion of the Great Frederick himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soult, Bernadotte, Augereau, Ney, and Davoust, with the several corps
      under their command, pursued the routed forces with untiring hostility. In
      vain did the King of Prussia address a supplicating letter asking for a
      suspension of arms. Napoleon scarcely deigned a reply, and ordered the
      advanced guard to march on Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a year before and he had issued his royal mandates from the palace of
      the Caesars; and he burned now to date his bulletins from the palace of
      the Great Frederick. And on the tenth day after the battle of Jena the
      troops of Lannes's division bivouacked in the plain around Potsdam. I had
      joined my brigade the day previous, and entered Berlin with them on the
      morning of the 23d of October.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations for a triumphal entry were made on the day before; and by
      noon the troops approached the capital in all the splendor of full
      equipment. First came the grenadiers of Oudinot's brigade,&mdash;one of
      the finest corps in the French army; their bright yellow facings and
      shoulder-knots had given them the <i>sobriquet</i> of the <i>Grenadiers
      jaunes</i>: they formed part of Davonst's force at Auerstadt, and were
      opposed to the Prussian guard in the greatest shock of the entire day.
      After them came two battalions of the <i>Chasseurs à pied</i>,&mdash;a
      splendid body of infantry, the remnant of four thousand who went into
      battle on the morning of the 15th. Then followed a brigade of artillery,
      each gun-carriage surmounted by a Prussian standard. These again were
      succeeded by the red lancers of Berg, with Murat himself at their head;
      for they were his own regiment, and he felt justly proud of such
      followers: the grand duke was in all the splendor of his full dress, and
      wore a Spanish hat, looped up, with an immense brilliant in front, and a
      plume of ostrich feathers floated over his neck and shoulders. Two hundred
      and forty chosen men of the Imperial Guard marched two and two after
      these, each carrying a color taken from the enemy in battle. Nansouty's
      cuirassiers came next; they had suffered severely at Jena, and were
      obliged to muster several of their wounded men to fill up the gaps in
      their squadrons. Then there were the horse artillery brigade, whose
      uniforms and equipments, notwithstanding every effort to conceal it,
      showed the terrible effects of the great battle. General d'Auvergne's
      division, with the hussars and the light cavalry attached, followed. These
      were succeeded by the voltigeurs, and eight battalions of the Imperial
      Guard,&mdash;whose ranks were closed up with the <i>Grenadiers à cheval</i>,
      and more artillery,&mdash;in all, a force of eighteen thousand, the <i>élite</i>
      of the French army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advancing in orderly time, they came,&mdash;no sound heard save the dull
      reverberation of the earth as it trembled beneath the columns, when the
      hoarse challenge to &ldquo;halt&rdquo; was called from rank to rank as often as those
      in the rear pressed on the leading files; but as they reached the
      Brandenburg gate, the band of each regiment burst forth, and the wide
      Platz resounded with the clang of martial music.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the palace stood the Emperor, surrounded by his staff, which
      was joined in succession by each general of brigade as his corps moved by.
      A simple acknowledgment of the military salute was all Napoleon gave as
      each battalion passed,&mdash;until the small party of the Imperial Guard
      appeared, bearing the captured colors. Then his proud features relaxed,
      his eye flashed and sparkled, and he lifted his chapeau straight above his
      head, and remained uncovered the whole time they were marching past. This
      was the moment when enthusiasm could no longer be restrained, and a cry of
      &ldquo;Vive l'Empereur!&rdquo; burst forth, that, caught up by those behind, rose in
      ten thousand echoes along the distant suburbs of Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      To look upon that glorious and glittering band, bronzed with battle, their
      proud faces lit up with all the pride of victory, was indeed a triumph;
      and one instinctively turned to see the looks of wondering and admiration
      such a sight must have inspired. But with what sense of sadness came the
      sudden thought: this is the proud exultation of the conqueror over the
      conquered; here come no happy faces and bright looks to welcome those who
      have rescued them from slavery; here are no voices calling welcome to the
      deliverer. No: it was a people crushed and trodden down; their hard-won
      laurels tarnished and dishonored; their country enslaved; their monarch a
      wanderer, no one knew where. Little thought they who raised the statue of
      brass to the memory of the Great Frederick, that the clank of French
      musketry would be heard around it. Rossbach was, indeed, avenged,&mdash;and
      cruelly avenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never did a people behave with more dignity under misfortune than the
      Prussians on the entrance of the French into their capital. The streets
      were deserted; the houses closed; the city was in mourning; and none
      stooped to the slavish adulation which might win favor with the conqueror.
      It was a triumph; but there were none to witness it. Of the nobles, scarce
      one remained in Berlin. They had fallen in battle, or followed the
      fortunes of their beaten army, now scattered and dispersed through the
      kingdom. Their wives and daughters, in deepest mourning, bewailed their
      ruined country as they would the death of a dearest friend. They cut off
      their blonde locks, and sorrowed like those without a hope. Their great
      country was to be reduced to the rank of a mere German province; their
      army disbanded; their king dethroned. Such was the contrast to our hour of
      triumph; such the sad reverse to the gorgeous display of our armed
      squadrons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the Emperor established his headquarters at Potsdam than the
      whole administration of the kingdom was begun to be placed under French
      rule. Prefects were appointed to different departments of the kingdom; a
      heavy contribution was imposed upon the nation; and all the offices of the
      state were subjected to the control of persons named by the Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these, the first in importance was the post-office; for, while every
      precaution was taken that no interruption should occur in the transmission
      of the mails as usual, a <i>cabinet noir</i> was established here, as at
      Paris, whose function it was to open the letters of suspected persons, and
      make copies of them; the latter, indeed, were often so skilfully executed
      as to be forwarded to the address, while the originals were preserved as
      &ldquo;proofs&rdquo; against parties, if it were found necessary to accuse them
      afterwards. (And here I might mention that the art of depositing metals in
      a mould by galvanic process was known and used in imitating and
      fabricating the seals of various writers, many years before the discovery
      became generally known in Europe.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The invasion of private right involved in this breach of trust gave, as
      might be supposed, the greatest offence throughout the kingdom. But the
      severity with which every case of suspicious meaning was followed up and
      punished converted the feelings of indignation and anger into those of
      fear and trepidation. For this was ever part of Napoleon's policy: the
      penalty of any offence was made to exclude the sense of ridicule its own
      littleness might have created, and men felt indisposed to jest where their
      mirth might end in melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most remarkable case, and that which more than any other impressed the
      public mind of the period, was that of the Prince de Hatzfeld, whose
      letter to the King of Prussia was opened at the post-office, and made the
      subject of a capital charge against him. Its contents were, as might be
      imagined from the channel of transmission, not such as could substantiate
      any treasonable intention on his part. A respectful homage to his
      dethroned sovereign; a detail of the mournful feeling experienced
      throughout his capital; and some few particulars of the localities
      occupied by the French troops, was the entire. And for this he was tried
      and condemned to death,&mdash;a sentence which the Emperor commanded to be
      executed before sunset that same day. Happily for the fate of the noble
      prince, as for the fair fame of Napoleon, both Duroc and Rapp were
      ardently attached to him, and at their earnest entreaties his life was
      spared. But the impression which the circumstances made upon the minds of
      the inhabitants was deep and lasting; and there was a day to come when all
      these insults were to be remembered and avenged. If I advert to the
      occurrence here, it is because I have but too good reason to bear memory
      of it, influencing, as it did, my own future fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that one evening, when sitting in a café with some of my
      brother officers, the subject of the Prince de Hatzfeld's offence was
      mooted; and in the unguarded freedom with which one talks to his comrades,
      I expressed myself delighted at the clemency of the Emperor, and conceived
      that he could have no part in the breach of confidence which led to the
      accusation, nor countenance in any way his prosecution. My companions, who
      had little sympathy for Prussians, and none for aristocracy whatever, took
      a different view of the matter, and scrupled not to regret that the
      sentence of the court-martial had not been executed. The discussion grew
      warm between us; the more, as I was alone in my opinion, and assailed by
      several who overbore me with loud speaking. Once or twice, too, an obscure
      taunt was thrown out against aliens and foreigners, who, it was alleged,
      never could at heart forgive the ascendency of France and Frenchmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this I replied hotly, for while not taking to myself an insult which my
      conduct in the service palpably refuted, I was hurt and offended. Alas! I
      knew too well in my heart what sacrifices I had made in changing my
      country; how I had bartered all the hopes which attach to one's fatherland
      for a career of mere selfish ambition. Long since had I seen that the
      cause I fought in was not that of liberty, but despotism. Napoleon's glory
      was the dazzling light which blinded my true vision; and my following had
      something of infatuation, against which reason was powerless. I say that I
      answered these taunts with hasty temper; and carried away by a momentary
      excitement, I told them, that they it was, not I, who would detract from
      the fair renown of the Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The traits you would attribute to him,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are not those of
      strength, but weakness. Is it the conqueror of Egypt, of Austria, and now
      of Prussia, who need stoop to this? We cannot be judges of his policy, or
      the great events which agitate Europe. We would pronounce most ignorantly
      on the greatness of his plans regarding the destinies of nations; but, on
      a mere question of high and honorable feeling, of manly honesty, why
      should we not speak? And here I say this act was never his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile of sardonic meaning was the only reply this speech met with; and
      one by one the officers rose and dropped off, leaving me to ponder over
      the discussion, in which I now remembered I had been betrayed into a
      warmth beyond discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This took place early in November; and as it was not referred to in any
      way afterwards by my comrades, I soon forgot it. My duties occupied me
      from morning till night; for General d'Auvergne, being in attendance on
      the Emperor, had handed me over for the time to the department of the
      adjutant-general of the army, where my knowledge of German was found
      useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 17th of the month a general order was issued, containing the names
      of the various officers selected for promotion, as well as of those on
      whom the cross of the &ldquo;Legion&rdquo; was to be conferred. Need I say with what a
      thrill of exultation I read my own name among the latter, nor my delight
      at finding it followed by the words, &ldquo;By order of his Majesty the Emperor,
      for a special service on the 13th October, 1806.&rdquo; This was the night
      before the battle; and now I saw that I had not been forgotten, as I
      feared,&mdash;here was proof of the Emperor's remembrance of me. Perhaps
      the delay was intended to test my prudence as to secrecy; and perhaps it
      was deemed fitting that my name should not appear except in the general
      list: in any case, the long-wished reward was mine,&mdash;the proud
      distinction I had desired for so many a day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distribution of the &ldquo;cordons&rdquo; was always made the occasion of a grand
      military spectacle, and the Emperor determined that the present one should
      convey a powerful impression of the effective strength of his army, as
      well as of its perfect equipment; and accordingly orders were despatched
      to the different generals of division within twelve or fifteen leagues of
      Berlin, to march their corps to the capital. The 28th of November was the
      day fixed for this grand display, and all was bustle and preparation for
      the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 22d, I received an official note from the bureau of
      the adjutant-general desiring me to wait on him before noon that same day.
      Concluding it referred to my promised promotion to the &ldquo;Legion,&rdquo; it was
      with somewhat of a fluttered and excited feeling I found myself, at some
      few minutes after eleven o'clock, in the antechamber, which already was
      crowded with officers, some seeking, some summoned to an interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the buzz of conversation, which, despite the reserve of
      the place, still prevailed, I heard my name called, and followed an
      aide-de-camp along a passage into a large room, which opened into a
      smaller apartment, where, standing with his back to the fire, I perceived
      Marshal Berthier, his only companion being an officer in a staff uniform,
      busily engaged writing at a table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Captain Burke, of the Eighth Hussars, I believe, sir?&rdquo; said the
      marshal, reading slowly from a slip of paper he held twisted round one
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By birth an Irishman,&rdquo; continued the marshal; &ldquo;entered at the
      Polytechnique in August, 1801. Am I correct?&rdquo; I bowed. &ldquo;Subsequently
      accused of being concerned in the conspiracy of Georges and Pichegru,&rdquo;
       resumed he, as he raised his eyes slightly from the paper, and fixed them
      searchingly upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Falsely so, sir,&rdquo; was my only reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were acquitted,&mdash;that's enough: a reprimand for imprudence, and
      a slight punishment of arrest, was all. Since that time, you have
      conducted yourself, as the report of your commanding officer attests, with
      zeal and steadiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused here, and seemed as if he expected me to say something; but as I
      thought the whole a most strange commencement to the ceremony of investing
      me with a cross of the Legion, I remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Paris, when attached to the <i>élite</i>, you appear to have visited
      the Duchess of Montserrat, and frequented her soirées.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once, sir; but once I was in the house of the duchess. My visit could
      scarcely have occupied as many minutes as I have spent here this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dined occasionally at the 'Moisson d'Or,&rdquo; continued the marshal, not
      noticing in any way my reply. &ldquo;Well, as I believe you are now aware that
      there are no secrets with his Majesty's Government, perhaps you will
      inform me what are your relations with the Chevalier Duchesne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes previous my mind was dwelling on that personage; and I
      answered the question in a few words, by stating the origin of our
      acquaintance, and briefly adverting to its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You correspond with the chevalier?&rdquo; said he, interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never done so; nor is it likely, from the manner in which we
      parted last, that I ever shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This scarcely confirms that impression, sir,&rdquo; said the marshal, taking an
      open letter from the table and holding it up before me. &ldquo;You know his
      handwriting; is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have no doubt it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, that letter belongs to you; you may take and read it. There is
      enough there, sir, to make your conduct the matter of a court-martial; but
      I am satisfied that a warning will be sufficient. Let this be such then.
      Learn, sir, that the plottings of a poor and mischievous party harmonize
      ill with the duties of a brave soldier; and that a captain of the Guards
      might choose more suitable associates than the dupes and double-dealers of
      the Faubourg St. Germain. There is your brevet to the 'Legion,' signed by
      the Emperor. I shall return it to his Majesty; mayhap at some future
      period your conduct may merit differently. I need hardly say that a
      gentleman so very little particular in the choice of his friends would be
      a most misplaced subject for the honor of the 'Legion.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand in sign for me to withdraw, and overwhelmed with
      confusion, I bowed and left the room. Nor was it till the door closed
      behind me that I felt how cruelly and unjustly I had been treated; then
      suddenly the blood rushed to my face and temples, my head seemed as if it
      would burst at either side, and forgetting every circumstance of place and
      condition, I seized the handle of the door and wrenched it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marshal,&rdquo; said I, with the fearlessness of one resolved at any risk to
      vindicate his character, &ldquo;I know nothing of this letter; I have not read
      one line of it. I have no further intimacy with the writer than an officer
      has with his comrade; but if I am to be the subject of espionage to the
      police,&mdash;if my chance acquaintances in the world are to be matter of
      charges against my fealty and honor,&mdash;if I, who have nothing but my
      sword and my epaulette&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I had got thus far I saw the marshal's face turn deadly pale, while
      the officer at the table made a hurried sign to me with his finger to be
      silent. The door closed nearly at the same instant, and I turned my head
      round, and there stood the Emperor. The figure is still before me; he was
      standing still, his hands behind his back, and his low chapeau deeply
      pressed upon his brows. His gray frock was open, and looked as if
      disordered from haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; said he, in that hissing tone he always assumed when in
      moments of passion,&mdash;&ldquo;what is this? Are we in the bureau of a
      minister? or is it the <i>salle de police?</i> Who are you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the question had been repeated that I found courage to
      reply. But he waited not for my answer, as, snatching the open letter from
      my fingers, he resumed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not thus, sir, you should come here. Your petition or memorial&mdash;
      Ha! <i>parbleu!</i> what is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the instant his eyes fell upon the writing, and as suddenly his face
      grew almost livid. With the rapidity of lightning he seemed to peruse the
      lines. Then waving his hand, he motioned towards the door, and muttered,&mdash;&ldquo;Wait
      without!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like one awaking from a dreadful dream, I stood, endeavoring to recall my
      faculties, and assure myself how much there might be of reality in my
      wandering fancies, when I perceived that a portion of the letter remained
      between my fingers as the Emperor snatched it from my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-finished sentence was all I could make out; but its tone made me
      tremble for what the rest of the epistle might contain:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surpassed themselves, of course, my dear Burke; and so has the Emperor
      too. It remained for the campaign in Prussia to prove that one hundred and
      eighty-five thousand prisoners can be taken from an army numbering one
      hundred and fifty-four thousand men. As to Davoust, who really had all the
      fighting, though he wrote no bulletin, all Paris feels&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the morsel I had saved; such a specimen of the insolence of the
      entire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dreadful fact then broke suddenly upon me that this letter had been
      written by Duchesne to effect my ruin; and as I stood stupefied with
      terror, the door was suddenly opened, and the Emperor passed, out. His
      eyes were turned on me as he went, and I shrank back from their expression
      of withering anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Burke!&rdquo; said a voice from within the room, for the door continued
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entered slowly, but with a firm step. My mind was made up; and in the
      force of a resolute determination, I found strength for whatever might
      happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would appear, sir,&rdquo; said the marshal, addressing me with a stern and
      severe expression of features, &ldquo;it would appear that you permit yourself
      the widest liberty in canvassing the acts of his Majesty the Emperor; for
      I find you here mentioned &ldquo;&mdash;he took a paper from the table as he
      spoke&mdash;&ldquo;as declaiming, in a public café, on the subject of the Prince
      de Hatzfeld, and expressing, in no measured terms, your disapproval of his
      imprisonment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that I said upon the subject, sir, so far as I can recollect, was in
      praise of the Emperor for clemency so well bestowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no high-flown sentiment on the breach of honorable confidence
      effected in opening private letters?&rdquo; said the marshal, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I do remember expressing myself strongly on that head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not surprised, sir,&rdquo; interrupted he, &ldquo;at your indignation; your own
      conscience must have prompted you on the occasion. When a gentleman has
      such correspondents as the Chevalier Duchesne, he may well feel on a point
      like this. But enough of this. I have his Majesty's orders regarding you,
      which are as follows&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, I beg you, sir, the liberty of interrupting you for one
      moment. I am an alien, and therefore little versed in the habits and
      usages of the land for whose service I have shed my blood; but I am sure a
      marshal of France will not refuse a kindness to an officer of the army,
      however humble his station. I merely ask the answer to one question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said the marshal, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I, as an officer, at liberty to resign my grade, and quit the
      service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>parbleu!</i>&rdquo; said he, reddening, &ldquo;yes, that you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then here I do so,&rdquo; rejoined I, drawing my sword from its scabbard. &ldquo;The
      career I can no longer follow honorably and independently, I shall follow
      no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your corps, sir?&rdquo; said the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Eighth Hussars of the Guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a note of that, Gardanne. I shall spare you all unnecessary delay in
      tendering a written resignation of your rank; I accept it now. You leave
      Berlin in twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your passport shall be made out for Paris; you shall receive it to-morrow
      morning.&rdquo; He motioned with his hand towards the door as he concluded, and
      I left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment I felt myself alone, the courage which had sustained me
      throughout at once gave way, and I leaned against the wall, and covered my
      face with my hands. Yes, I knew it in my heart,&mdash;the whole dream of
      life was over; the path of glory was closed to me forever; all the hopes
      on which, in sanguine hours, I used to feed my heart, were scattered. And
      to the miseries of my exiled lot were now added the sorrows of an
      unfriended, companionless existence. The thought that no career was open
      to me came last; for at first I only remembered all I was leaving, not the
      dark future before me. Yet, when I called to mind the injustice with which
      I had been treated,&mdash;the system of espionage to which, as an alien
      more particularly, I was exposed,&mdash;I felt I had done right, and that
      to have remained in the service at such a sacrifice of my personal
      independence would have been base and unworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a half-broken heart and faltering step I regained my quarters, where
      again my grief burst forth with more violence than at first. Every object
      about recalled to me the career I was leaving forever; and wherever my eye
      rested, some emblem lay to open fresh stores of sorrow. The pistols I
      carried at Elchingen, a gift from General d'Auvergne; an Austrian sabre I
      had taken from its owner, still ornamented with a little knot of ribbon
      Minette had fastened to the hilt,&mdash;hung above the chimney; and I
      could scarce look on them without tears. On the table still lay open the
      <i>ordre du jour</i> which named me to the Legion of Honor; and now the
      humblest soldier that carried his musket in the ranks was my superior. Not
      all the principle on which I founded my resolve was proof against this
      first outburst of my sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chivalrous ardor of a soldier's life had long supplied to me the place
      of those appliances to happiness which other men possess. Each day I
      followed it the path grew dearer to me. Every bold and daring feat, every
      deed of enterprise or danger, seemed to bring me, in thought at least,
      nearer to him whose greatness was my idolatry. And now, all this was to be
      as a mere dream,&mdash;a thing which had been, and was to be no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I revolved such sad reflections, a single knock came to my door. I
      opened it, and saw a soldier of my own regiment. His dress was
      travel-stained and splashed, and he looked like one off a long journey. He
      knew me at once, and accosted me by name, as he presented a letter from
      General d'Auvergne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've had a smart ride,&rdquo; said I, as I surveyed his flushed face and
      disordered uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Captain,&mdash;from the Oder. Our division is full twelve leagues
      from this. I left on yesterday morning; for the general was particular
      that the charger should not suffer on the way,&mdash;as if a beast like
      that would mind double the distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time I had opened the letter, which merely contained the following
      few lines:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      Encampment on the Oder, Nov. 21, 1806.

      My dear Burke,&mdash;Every new arrival here has brought me some
      fresh intelligence of you, and of your conduct at Jena; nor
      can I say with what pride I have heard that the Emperor has
      included you among the list of the <i>décorés</i>. This is the
      day I often prophesied for you, and the true and only
      refutation against the calumnies of the false-hearted and
      the envious. I send you a Polish charger for your gala
      review. Accept him from me; and believe that you have no
      warmer friend, nor more affectionate, than yours,

      D'Auvergne, Lieut-General.
</pre>
    <p>
      Before I had finished reading the letter, my eyes grew so dimmed I could
      scarcely trace the letters. Each word of kindness, every token of praise,
      now cut me to the heart. How agonizing are the congratulations of friends
      on those events in life where our own conscience bears reproach against
      us! how poignant the self-accusation that is elicited by undeserved
      eulogy! How would <i>he</i> think of my conduct? By what means should I
      convince <i>him</i> that no alternative remained to me? I turned away,
      lest the honest soldier should witness my trouble; and as I approached the
      window, I beheld in the courtyard beneath the beautiful charger which,
      with the full trappings of a hussar saddle, stood proudly flapping his
      deep flanks with his long silken tail. With what a thrill I surveyed him!
      How my heart leaped, as I fancied myself borne along on the full tide of
      battle, each plunge he gave responsive to the stroke of my sword-arm! For
      an instant I forgot all that had happened, and gazed on his magnificent
      crest and splendid shape with an ecstasy of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the dragoon, whose eyes were riveted in the same quarter,
      &ldquo;there's not a marshal of France so well mounted; and he knows the
      trumpet-call like the oldest soldier of the troop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will return to-morrow,&rdquo; said I, recovering myself suddenly, and
      endeavoring to appear composed and at ease. &ldquo;Well, then, to-night I shall
      give you an answer for the general; be here at eight o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that my troubled air and broken voice had not escaped the soldier's
      notice, and was glad when the door closed, and I was again alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first care was to write to the general; nor was it till after many
      efforts I succeeded to my satisfaction in conveying, in a few and simple
      words, the reasons of that step which must imbitter my future life. I
      explained how deeply continued mistrust had wounded me; how my spirit, as
      a soldier and a gentleman, revolted at the espionage established over my
      actions; that it was in weighing these insults against the wreck of all my
      hopes, I had chosen that path which had neither fame nor rank nor honor,
      but still left me an untrammelled spirit and a mind at peace with itself.
      &ldquo;I have now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to begin the world anew, without one clew to guide
      me. Every illusion with which I had invested life has left me; I must
      choose both a career and a country, and bear with me from this nothing but
      the heartfelt gratitude I shall ever retain for one who befriended me
      through weal and woe, and whose memory I shall bless while I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt relieved and more at ease when I finished this letter; the endeavor
      to set my conduct in its true light to another had also its effect upon my
      own convictions. I knew, besides, that I had sacrificed to my
      determination all my worldly prospects, and believed that where
      self-interest warred with principle, the right course could scarcely be
      doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, not one thought ever occurred to me of how I was to meet
      the future. It was strange; but so perfectly had the present crisis filled
      my mind, there was not room for even a glance at what was to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passport was made out for Paris, and thither I must go. So much was
      decided for me without intervention on my part; and now it only remained
      for me to dispose of the little trappings of my former estate, and take
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jews who always accompanied the army, offered a speedy resource in
      this emergency. My anxiety to leave Berlin by daybreak, and thus avoid a
      meeting of any acquaintances there, made me accept of the sums they
      offered. To them such negotiations were of daily occurrence, and they well
      knew how to profit by them. My whole worldly wealth consisted of two
      hundred napoleons; and with this small pittance to begin life, I sat
      myself down to think whither I should turn, or what course adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed over thus, and when day dawned, I had not closed my eyes.
      About four o'clock the diligence in which I had secured a place for Weimar
      drew up at my door. I hurried down, and mounting to a seat beside the <i>conducteur</i>,
      I buried my face in the folds of my cloak, nor dared to look up until we
      had passed beyond the precincts of the city, and were travelling along on
      the vast plain of sand which surrounds Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>conducteur</i> was a Prussian, and divining my military capacity in
      my appearance, he maintained a cold and distant civility; never speaking,
      except when spoken to, and even then in as few words as possible. This was
      itself a relief to me; my heart was too full of its own sufferings to find
      pleasure in conversation, and I dreamed away the hours till nightfall.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. A FOREST PATH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I reached Wiemar I quitted the diligence, resolved to make the
      remainder of the journey on foot; for thus I should both economize the
      little means I possessed, and escape many of the questionings and
      inquiries to which as a traveller by public conveyance I was exposed.
      Knapsack on shoulder, then, and staff in hand, I plodded onward, and
      although frequently coming up with others on their way homeward, I avoided
      all companionship with those whom I could no longer think of as comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two tides of population which met upon that great highway told the
      whole history of war. Here came the young soldiers, fresh enrolled in the
      conscription, glowing with ardor, and bounding with life and buoyancy, and
      mingling their village songs with warlike chants. There, footsore and
      weary, with tattered uniform and weather-beaten look, toiled along the
      tired veteran, turning as he went a glance of compassionate contempt on
      those whose wild <i>vivas</i> burst forth in greeting. As for me, I could
      neither partake of the high hopes of the one, nor sympathize with the
      war-worn nature of the other. Disappointment, bitter disappointment, in
      every cherished expectation, had thrown a chill over me, and I wanted even
      the energy to become reckless. In this state, I did not dare to face the
      future, but in moody despondency reflected on the past. Was this the
      destiny Marie de Meudon predicted for me? was the ever-present thought of
      my mind. Is it thus I should appear before her?
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred times came the thought to join the new levies as a soldier, to
      carry a musket in the ranks. But then came back in all its force the
      memory of the distrust and suspicion my services had met with: the
      conviction hourly became clearer to me, that I fought not for liberty, but
      despotism; that it was not freedom, but slavery, in whose cause I shed my
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid meeting with the detachments which each day occupied the road, I
      turned from the <i>chaussée</i> on passing Eisenach, and took a forest
      path that led through Murbach to Fulda. My path led through the Creutz
      Mountains,&mdash;a wild and unfrequented tract of country, where few
      cottages were to be seen, and scarcely a village existed. Vast forests of
      dark pines, or bleak and barren mountains, stretched away on either side;
      a few patches of miserable tillage here and there met the view; but the
      scene was one of saddening influence, and harmonized but too nearly with
      my own despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reach a place of shelter for the night, I was more than once obliged to
      walk twelve leagues during the day, and had thus to set out before
      daylight. This exertion, however, brought its own reward: the stimulant of
      labor, the necessity of a task, gradually allayed the mental irritation I
      suffered under; a healthier and more manly tone of thinking succeeded to
      my former regrets; and with a heart elevated, if not cheered, I continued
      my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third day of my toilsome journey was drawing to a close. A mass of
      heavy and lowering clouds, dark and thunder-charged, slowly moved along
      the sky; and a low, moaning sound, that seemed to sigh along the ground,
      boded the approach of a storm. I was still three leagues from my
      halting-place, and began to deliberate within myself whether the dense
      pine-wood, which came down to the side of the road, might not afford a
      safer refuge from the hurricane than the chances of reaching a house
      before it broke forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shepherds who frequented these dreary tracts often erected little huts
      of bark as a shelter against the cold and severity of the wintry days, and
      to find out one of these now was my great endeavor. Scarcely had I formed
      the resolve, when I perceived a small path opening into the wood, at the
      entrance to which a piece of board nailed against the trunk of a tree,
      gave tidings that such a place of security was not far distant. These
      signs of forest life I had learned in my wanderings, and now strode
      forward with renewed vigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path led gradually upwards, along the mountain-side, which soon became
      so encumbered with brushwood that I had much difficulty in pushing my way,
      and at last began to doubt whether I might not have wandered from the
      track. The darkness was now complete; night had fallen, and a heavy
      crashing rain poured down upon the tree-tops, but could not penetrate
      through their tangled shelter. The wind, too, swept in loud gusts above,
      and the long threatened storm began. A loud, deafening roar, like that of
      the sea itself, arose, as the leafy branches bent before the blast, or
      snapped with sudden shock beneath the hurricane; clap after clap of
      thunder resounded, and then the rain descended in torrents,&mdash;the
      heavy drops at last, trickling from leaf to leaf, reaching me as I stood.
      Once more I pushed forward, and had not gone many paces when the red glare
      of a fire caught my eye. Steadfastly fastening my gaze upon the flame, I
      hurried on, and at length perceived with ecstasy that the light issued
      from the window of a small hovel, such as I have already mentioned. To
      gain the entrance of the hut I was obliged to pass the window, and could
      not resist the temptation to give a glance at the interior, whose cheerful
      blaze betokened habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not without surprise that, instead of the figure of a shepherd
      reposing beside his fire, I beheld that of an old man, whose dress bespoke
      the priest, kneeling in deep devotion at the foot of a small crucifix
      attached to the wall. Not all the wild sounds of the raging storm seemed
      to turn his attention from the object of his worship; his eyes were
      closed, but the head thrown backwards showed his face upturned, when the
      lips moved rapidly in prayer. Never had I beheld so perfect a picture of
      intense devotional feeling; every line in his marked countenance indicated
      the tension of a mind filled with one engrossing thought, while his
      tremulous hands, clasped before him, shook with the tremor of strong
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a contrast to the loud warring of the elements, that peaceful figure,
      raised above earth and its troubles, in the spirit of his holy communing!
      how deeply touching the calm serenity of his holy brow, with the rolling
      crash of falling branches, and the deep baying of the storm! I did not
      dare to interrupt him; and when I did approach the door it was with silent
      step and noiseless gesture. As I stood, the old priest&mdash;for now I saw
      that he was such&mdash;concluded his prayer, and detaching his crucifix
      from the wall, he kissed it reverently, and placed it in his bosom; then,
      rising slowly from his knees, he turned towards me. A slight start of
      surprise, as quickly followed by a smile of kindly greeting, escaped him,
      while he said in French,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome, my son; come in and share with me the shelter, for it is
      a wild night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wild night, indeed, Father,&rdquo; said I, casting my eyes around the little
      hut, where nothing indicated the appearance of habitation. &ldquo;I could have
      wished you a better home than this against the storms of winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a traveller like yourself,&rdquo; said he, smiling at my mistake; &ldquo;and a
      countryman, too, if I mistake not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The accents in which these words were spoken pronounced him a Frenchman,
      and a very little sufficed to ratify the terms of our companionship; and
      having thrown a fresh billet on the fire, we both seated ourselves before
      it My wallet was, fortunately, better stored than the good father's; and
      having produced its contents, we supped cheerfully, and like men who were
      not eating their first bivouac meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive, Father,&rdquo; said I, as I remarked the manner in which he
      disposed his viands, &ldquo;I perceive you have campaigned ere now; the habits
      of the service are not easily mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not need that observation of yours,&rdquo; replied he, laughing slightly,
      &ldquo;to convince me you were a soldier; for, as you truly say, the camp leaves
      its indelible traces behind it. You are hastening on to Berlin, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I blushed deeply at the question; the shame of my changed condition had
      been hitherto confined to my own heart, but now it was to be confessed
      before a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask your pardon, my son, for a question I had no right to ask; and even
      there, again, I but showed my soldier education. I am returning to France;
      and in seeking a short path from Eisenach, found myself where you see; as
      night was falling, well content to be so well lodged,&mdash;all the more,
      if I am to have your companionship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Few and simple as these words were, there was a tone of frankness in them,
      not less than the evidence of a certain good breeding, by which he
      apologized for his own curiosity in speaking thus freely of himself, that
      satisfied me at once; and I hastened to inform him that circumstances had
      induced me to leave the service, in which I had been a captain, and that I
      was now, like himself, returning to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not think, Father,&rdquo; added I, with some eagerness, &ldquo;you must not
      think that other reasons than my own free will have made me cease to be a
      soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would ill become me to have borne such a suspicion,&rdquo; interrupted he,
      quickly. &ldquo;When one so young and full of life as you are leaves the path
      where lie honor and rank and fame, he must have cause to make the
      sacrifice; for I can scarce think, that at your age, these things seem
      nought to your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Father, they are not so. They have been my guiding stars
      for many a day; alas, that they can be such no longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are higher hopes to cherish than these,&rdquo; said he, solemnly,&mdash;&ldquo;higher
      than the loftiest longings of ambition; but we all of us cling to the
      things of life, till in their perishable nature they wean us off with
      disappointment and sorrow. From such a trial am I now suffering,&rdquo; added
      he, in a low voice, while the tears rose to his eyes and slowly coursed
      along his pale cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause neither of us felt inclined to break, when at length the
      priest said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was your corps in the service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Eighth Hussars of the Guard,&rdquo; said I, trembling at every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>he</i> was in the Guides,&rdquo; repeated he, mournfully, to himself;
      &ldquo;you knew the regiment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they belonged to the Guard also; they wore no epaulettes, but a
      small gold arrow on the collar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like this,&rdquo; said he, unfastening the breast of his cassock, and taking
      out a small package, which, among other things, contained the designation
      of the <i>Corps des Guides</i> in an arrow of gold embroidery. &ldquo;Had he not
      beautiful hair, long and silky as a girl's?&rdquo; said he, as he produced a
      lock of light and sunny brown. &ldquo;Poor Alphonse! thou wouldst have been
      twenty hadst thou lived till yesterday. If I shed tears, young man, it is
      because I have lost the great earthly solace of my solitary life. Others
      have kindred and friends, have happy homes, which, even when bereavements
      come, with time will heal up the wound; I had but him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was your nephew, perhaps?&rdquo; said I, half fearing to interfere with his
      sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man shook his head in token of dissent, while he muttered to
      himself,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auerstadt may be a proud memory to some; to me it is a word of sorrow and
      mourning. The story is but a short one; alas! it has but one color
      throughout:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count Louis de Meringues&mdash;of whom you have doubtless heard that he
      rode as postilion to the carriage of his sovereign in the celebrated
      flight to Varennes&mdash;fell by the guillotine the week after the king's
      trial; the countess was executed on the same scaffold as her husband. I
      was the priest who accompanied her at the moment; and in my arms she
      placed her only child,&mdash;an infant boy of two years. There was a cry
      among the crowd to have the child executed also, and many called out that
      the spawn would be a serpent one day, and it were better to crush it while
      it was time; but the little fellow was so handsome, and looked so
      winningly around him on the armed ranks and the glancing weapons, that
      even <i>their</i> cruel hearts relented, and he was spared. It is to me
      like yesterday, as I remember every minute circumstance; I can recall even
      the very faces of that troubled and excited assemblage, that at one moment
      screamed aloud for blood, and at the next were convulsed with savage
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I forced my way through the dense array, a rude arm was stretched out
      from the mass, and a finger dripping with the gore of the scaffold was
      drawn across the boy's face, while a ruffian voice exclaimed, 'The
      Meringues were ever proud of their blood; let us see if it be redder than
      other people's.' The child laughed; and the mob, with horrid mockery,
      laughed too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took him home with me to my <i>presbytère</i> at Sèvres,&mdash;for that
      was my parish,&mdash;and we lived together in peace until the terrible
      decree was issued which proclaimed all France atheist. Then we wandered
      southwards, towards that good land which, through every vicissitude, was
      true to its faith and its king,&mdash;La Vendée. At Lyons we were met by a
      party of the revolutionary soldiers, who, with a commissary of the
      Government, were engaged in raising young men for the conscription.
      Alphonse, who was twelve years old, felt all a boy's enthusiasm at the
      warlike display before him, and persuaded me to follow the crowd into the
      <i>Place des Terreaux</i>, where the numbers were read out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Paul Ducos,' cried a voice aloud, as we approached the stage on which
      the commissary and his staff were standing; 'where is this Paul Ducos?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I am here,' replied a fine, frank-looking youth, of some fifteen years;
      'but my father is blind, and I cannot leave him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We shall soon see that,' called out the commissary. 'Clerk, read out his
      <i>signalement</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Paul Ducos, son of Eugène Ducos, formerly calling himself Count Ducos de
      la Brèche&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Down with the Royalists! <i>à bas</i> the tyrants!' screamed the mob,
      not suffering the remainder to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Approach, Paul Ducos!' said the commissary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wait here, Father,' whispered the youth; 'I will come back presently.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the old man, a fine and venerable figure, the remnant of a noble
      race, held him fast, and, as his lips trembled, said, 'Do not leave me,
      Paul; my child, my comforter, stay near me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy looked round him for one face of kindly pity in this emergency,
      when, turning towards me, he said rapidly, 'Stand near him!' He broke from
      the old man's embrace, and rushing through the crowd, mounted the
      scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You are drawn for the conscription, young man,' said the commissary;
      'but in consideration of your father's infirmity, a substitute will be
      accepted. Have you such?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy shook his head mournfully and in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Have you any friend who would assist you here? Bethink you awhile,'
      rejoined the commissary, who, for his station and duties, was a kind and
      benevolent man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I have none. They have left us nothing, neither home nor friends,' said
      the youth, bitterly; 'and if it were not for his sake, I care not what
      they do with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Down with the tyrants!' yelled the mob, as they heard these haughty
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Then your fate is decreed,' resumed the commissary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, not yet!' cried out Alphonse, as, breaking from my side, he gained
      the steps and mounted the platform; 'I will be his substitute!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how shall I tell the bitter anguish of that moment, which at once
      dispelled the last remaining hope I cherished, and left me destitute
      forever. As I dashed the tears from my eyes and looked up, the two boys
      were locked in each other's arms. It was a sight to have melted any heart,
      save those around them; but bloodshed and crime had choked up every avenue
      of feeling, and left them, not men, but tigers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Alphonse de Meringues,' cried out the boy, in answer to a question
      regarding his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no such designation in France,' said a grim-looking,
      hard-featured man, who, wearing the tri-colored scarf, sat at the table
      beside the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I was never called by any other,' rejoined the youth, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Citizen Meringues,' interposed the commissary, mildly, 'what is your
      age?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I know not the years,' replied he; 'but I have heard that I was but an
      infant when they slew my father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fierce roar of passion broke from the mob below the scaffold as they
      heard this; and again the cry broke forth, 'Down with the tyrants!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Art thou, then, the son of that base sycophant who rode courier to the
      Capet to Varennes?' said the hard-featured man at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Of the truest gentleman of France,' called out a loud voice from below
      the platform; 'Vive le roi!' It was the blind man who spoke, and waved his
      cap above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'To the guillotine! to the guillotine!' screamed a hundred voices, in
      tones wilde than the cries of famished wolves, as, seizing the aged man,
      they tore his clothes to very rags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an instant all attention was turned from the platform to the scene
      below it, where, with shouts and screams of fury, the terrible mob yelled
      aloud for blood. In vain the guards endeavored to keep back the people,
      who twice rescued their victim from the hands of the soldiery; and already
      a confused murmur arose that the commissary himself was a traitor to the
      public, and favored the tyrants, when a dull, clanking sound rose above
      the tumult, and a cheer of triumph proclaimed the approach of the
      instrument of torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In their impetuous torrent of vengeance they had dragged the guillotine
      from the distant end of the 'Place,' where it usually stood; and there now
      still knelt the figure of a condemned man, lashed with his arms behind
      him, on the platform, awaiting the moment of his doom. Oh, that terrible
      face, whereon death had already set its seal! With glazed, lack-lustre
      eye, and cheek leaden and quivering, he gazed around on the fiendish
      countenances like one awakening from a dream, his lips parted as though to
      speak; but no sound came forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Place! place for Monsieur le Marquis!' shouted a ruffian, as he assisted
      to raise the figure of the blind man up the steps; and a ribald yell of
      fiendish laughter followed the brutal jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Thou art to make thy journey in most noble company,' said another to the
      culprit on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'An he see not his way in the next world better than in this, thou must
      lend him a hand, friend,' said a third. And with many a ruffian joke they
      taunted their victims, who stood on the last threshold of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the crowd upon the scaffold of the guillotine I could see the
      figure of the blind man as it leaned and fell on either side, as the
      movement of the mob bore it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>Parbleu!</i> these Royalists would rather kneel than stand,&rdquo; said a
      voice, as they in vain essayed to make the old man place his feet under
      him; and ere the laughter which this rude jest excited ceased, a cry broke
      forth of&mdash;'He is dead! he is dead!' And with a heavy sumph, the body
      fell from their hands; for when their power of cruelty ended, they cared
      not for the corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was true: life was extinct, none knew how,&mdash;whether from the
      violence of the mob in its first outbreak, or that a long-suffering heart
      had burst at last; but the chord was snapped, and he whose proud soul
      lately defied the countless thousands around, now slept with the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few seconds it seemed as though they felt that a power stronger than
      their own had interposed between them and their vengeance, and they stood
      almost aghast before the corpse, where no trace of blood proclaimed it to
      be their own; then, rallying from this stupor, with one voice they
      demanded that the son should atone for the crimes of the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I am ready,' cried the youth, in a voice above the tumult. 'I did not
      deem I could be grateful to ye for aught, but I am for this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To no purpose did the commissary propose a delay in the sentence; he was
      unsupported by his colleagues. The passions of the mob rose higher and
      higher; the thirst for blood, unslaked, became intense and maddening; and
      they danced in frantic glee around the guillotine, while they chanted one
      of the demoniac songs of the scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this moment, when the torrent ran in one direction, Alphonse might
      have escaped all notice, but that the condemned youth turned to embrace
      him once more before he descended from the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'They are so sorry to separate, it is a shame to part them,' cried a
      ruffian in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You forget, Citizen, that this boy is his substitute,' said the
      commissary, mildly; 'the Republic most not be cheated of its defenders.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Vive la République!' cried the soldiers; and the cry was re-echoed by
      thousands, while amid their cheers there rose the last faint sigh of an
      expiring victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scene was over; the crowd dispersed; and the soldiers marched back to
      quarters, accompanied by some hundred conscripts, among whom was Alphonse,&mdash;a
      vague, troubled expression betokening that he scarce knew what had
      happened around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The regiment to which he was appointed was at Toulon, and there I
      followed him. They were ordered to the north of Italy soon after, and
      thence to Egypt. Through the battlefields of Mount Tabor and the Pyramids
      I was ever beside him; on the heights of Austerlitz I stanched his wounds;
      and I laid him beneath the earth on the field of Auerstadt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man's voice trembled and became feeble as he finished speaking,
      and a settled expression of grief clothed his features, which were pale as
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see Sèvres once more,&rdquo; said he, after a pause. &ldquo;I must look on the
      old houses of the village, and the little gardens, and the venerable
      church; they will be the only things to greet me there now, but I must
      gaze on them ere I close my eyes to this world and its cares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Father,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;to one who has acted so noble a part as
      yours, life is never without its own means of happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke not of death,&rdquo; replied he, mildly; &ldquo;but the holy calm of a
      convent will better suit my seared and worn heart than all that the world
      calls its joys and pleasures. You, who are young and full of hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! Father, speak not thus. One can better endure the lowering skies of
      misfortune as the evening of life draws near than when the morn of
      existence is breaking. To me, with youth and health, there is no future,&mdash;no
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not hear you speak thus,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;fatigue and weariness
      are on you now. Wait until to-morrow,&mdash;we shall be fellow-travellers
      together; and then, if you will reveal to me your story, mayhap my long
      experience of the world may suggest comfort and consolation where you can
      see neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The storm by this time had abated much of its violence, and across the
      moon the large clouds were wafted speedily, disclosing bright patches of
      light at every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is our life here,&rdquo; said the father,&mdash;&ldquo;alternating with its days
      of happiness and sorrow. Let us learn, in the dark hour of our destiny, to
      bear the glare of our better fortunes; for, believe me, that when our joys
      are greatest, so are our trials also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased speaking, and I saw that soon afterwards his lips moved as if in
      prayer. I now laid myself down in my cloak beside the fire, and was soon
      buried in a sleep too sound even for a dream.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. A CHANCE MEETING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      With the good priest of Sèvres I journeyed along towards the frontier of
      France, ever selecting the least frequented paths, and such as were not
      likely to be taken by the troops of soldiery which daily moved towards
      Berlin. The frankness of my companion had made me soon at ease with him;
      and I told him, without reserve, the story of my life, down to the
      decisive moment of my leaving the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Father,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how completely my career has failed; how, with
      all the ardor of a soldier, with all the devotion of a follower, I have
      adhered to the Emperor's fortunes; and yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ambition, however great it was, could not stifle conscience. I can
      believe it well. They who go forth to the wars with high hopes and
      bounding hearts, who picture to their minds the glorious rewards of great
      achievements, should blind their eyes to the horrors and injustice of the
      cause they bleed for. Any sympathy with misfortune would sap the very
      principle of that heroism whose essence is success. Men cannot play the
      double game, even in matters of worldly ambition. Had you not listened to
      the promptings of your heart, you had been greater; had you not followed
      the dazzling glare of your hopes, you had been happier: both you could
      scarcely be. Be assured of this, my son, the triumphs of a country can
      only be enjoyed by the child of the soil; the brave soldier, who lends his
      arm to the cause, feels he has little part in the glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, indeed,&mdash;most true; I feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were it otherwise, how unsatisfying is the thirst for that same
      glory! how endless the path that leads to it! how many regrets accompany
      it! how many ties broken! how many friendships forfeited! No, no; return
      to your own land,&mdash;to the country of your birth; some honorable
      career will always present itself to him who seeks but independence and
      the integrity of his own heart. Beneath the conquering eagles of the
      Emperor there are men of every shade of political opinion; for the
      conscription is pitiless. There are Royalists, who love their king and
      hate the usurper; there are Jacobins, who worship freedom and detest the
      tyrant; there are stern Republicans&mdash;Vendéens, and followers of
      Moreau: but yet all are Frenchmen. 'La belle France' is the watchword that
      speaks to every heart, and patriotism is the bond between thousands. <i>You</i>
      have no share in this; the delusion of national glory can never throw its
      deception around you. Return, then, to your country; and be assured, that
      in <i>her</i> cause your least efforts will be more ennobling to yourself
      than the boldest deeds the hand of a mercenary ever achieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inborn desire to revisit my native land needed but the counsels of the
      priest to make it all-powerful; and as, day by day, I plodded onward, my
      whole thoughts turned to the chances of my escape, and the means by which
      I could accomplish my freedom; for the war still continued between France
      and England, and the blockade of the French ports was strictly maintained
      by a powerful fleet. The difficulty of the step only increased my desire
      to effect it; and a hundred projects did I revolve in my mind, without
      ever being able to fix on one where success seemed likely. The very
      resolve, however, had cheered my spirits, and given new courage to my
      heart; and an object suggested a hope,&mdash;and with a hope, life was no
      longer burdensome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each morning now I set forward with a mind more at ease, and more open to
      receive pleasure from the varied objects which met me as I went. Not so my
      poor companion; the fatigue of the journey, added to great mental
      suffering, began to prey upon his health, and brought back an ague he had
      contracted in Egypt, from the effect of which his constitution had never
      perfectly recovered. At first the malady showed itself only in great
      depression of spirits, which made him silent for hours of the way. But
      soon it grew worse; he walked with much difficulty, took but little
      nourishment, and seemed impressed with a sad foreboding that the disease
      must be fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to reach my village; my own quiet churchyard should have been my
      resting-place,&rdquo; said he, as he sank wearied and exhausted on a little bank
      at the roadside. &ldquo;But this was only a sick man's fancy. Poor Alphonse lies
      far away in the dreary plain of Auerstadt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun was just setting of a clear day in December as we halted on a
      little eminence, which commanded a distant view on every side. Behind lay
      the dark forest of Germany, the tree-tops presenting their massive wavy
      surface, over which the passing clouds threw momentary shadows; before,
      but still some miles away, we could trace the Rhine, its bright silver
      current sparkling in the sun; beyond lay the great plains of France, and
      upon these the sick man's eyes rested with a steadfast gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said he, after a long silence on both sides, &ldquo;the fields and the
      mountains, the sunshine and the shade, are like those of other lands; but
      the feeling which attaches the heart to country is an inborn sense, and
      the very word 'home' brings with it the whole history of our affections.
      Even to look thus at his native country is a blessing to an exile's
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I scarcely dared to interrupt the reverie which succeeded these few words;
      but when I perceived that he still remained seated, his head between his
      hands and lost in meditation, I ventured to remind him that we were still
      above a league from Heimbach, the little village where we should pass the
      night, and that on a road so wild and unfrequented there was little hope
      of finding shelter any nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must lean on me, Father; the night air is fresh and bracing, and
      after a little it will revive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man rose without speaking, and taking my arm, began the descent of
      the mountain. His steps, however, were tottering and uncertain, his
      breathing hurried and difficult, and his carriage indicated the very
      greatest debility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot do it, my son,&rdquo; said he, sinking upon the grassy bench which
      skirted the way; &ldquo;you must leave me. It matters little now where this
      frail body rests; a few hours more, and the rank grass will wave above it
      and the rain beat over it unfelt. Let us part here: an old man's blessing
      for all your kindness will follow you through life, and may cheer you to
      think on hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you then suppose I could leave you thus?&rdquo; said I, reproachfully. &ldquo;Is
      it so you think of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My minutes are few now, my child,&rdquo; replied he, more solemnly, &ldquo;and I
      would pass the last moments of my life alone. Well, then, if you will not,&mdash;leave
      me now for a little, and return to me; by that time my mind will be
      calmer, and mayhap, too, my strength greater, and I may be able to
      accompany you to the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I acceded to this proposal the more willingly, because it afforded me the
      hope of finding some means to convey him to Heimbach; and so, having
      wrapped him carefully in my cloak, I hastened down the mountain at the top
      of my speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The zigzag path by which I went discovered to me from time to time the
      lights of the little hamlet, which twinkled star-like in the valley; and
      as I drew nearer, the confused hum of voices reached me. I listened, and
      to my amazement heard the deep, hoarse bray of a trumpet. How well I knew
      that sound! it was the night-call to gather in the stragglers. I stopped
      to listen; and now, in the stillness, could mark the tramp of horsemen and
      the clank of their equipments: again the trumpet sounded, and was answered
      by another at some distance. The road lay straight below me at some
      hundred yards off, and leaving the path, I dashed directly downwards just
      as the leading horsemen of a small detachment came slowly up. To their
      loud <i>Qui vive?</i> I answered by giving an account of the sick man, and
      entreating the sergeant who commanded the party to lend assistance to
      convey him to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>parbleu!</i> that we will,&rdquo; said the honest soldier; &ldquo;a priest
      who has made the campaign of Egypt and Austria is worthy of all our care.
      Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a mile from this; but the road is not practicable for a horseman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you shall have two of my men; they will soon bring him hither.&rdquo; And
      as he spoke, he ordered two troopers to dismount, who, quickly
      disencumbering themselves of their sabres, prepared to follow me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall expect you at the bivouac,&rdquo; cried the sergeant, as he resumed
      his way; while I, eager to return, breasted the mountain with renewed
      energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You belong to the Guard, my friends,&rdquo; said I, as I paused for breath at a
      turn of the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fourth Cuirassiers of the Guard,&rdquo; replied the soldier I addressed;
      &ldquo;Milhaud's brigade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How my heart leaped as he said these words! They were part of the division
      General d'Auvergne once commanded; it was the regiment of poor Pioche,
      too, before the dreadful day of Austerlitz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the Fourth, then?&rdquo; rejoined the man, as he witnessed the
      agitation of my manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know the Fourth?&rdquo; echoed his comrade, in a voice of half-indignant
      meaning. &ldquo;<i>Sacrebleu!</i>who does not know them? Does not all the world
      know them by this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Fourth who wear the motto 'Dix contre un' on their caps,&rdquo; said
      I, desirous to flatter the natural vanity of my companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Monsieur; I see you have served also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered by a nod, for already every word, every gesture, recalled to me
      the career I had quitted; and my regrets, so late subdued by reason and
      reflection, came thronging back, and filled ray heart to bursting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurrying onward now, I mounted the steep path, and soon regained the spot
      I sought. The poor father was sleeping; overcome by fatigue and weariness,
      he had fallen on the mossy bank, and lay in a deep, soft slumber. Lifting
      him gently, the strong troopers crossed their hands beneath, and bore him
      along between them. For an instant he looked up; but seeing me at his
      side, he merely pressed my hand, and closed his eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i>&rdquo; said one of the dragoons, in a low voice, &ldquo;I should not
      be surprised if this were the Père Arsène, who served with the army in
      Italy. We used to call him 'old Scapulaire'. He was the only priest I ever
      saw in the van of a brigade. You knew him too, Auguste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that I did,&rdquo; replied the other soldier. &ldquo;I saw him at Elkankah,
      where one of ours was unhorsed by a Mameluke, spring forward, and seizing
      a pistol at the holster, shoot the Turk through the head, and then kneel
      down beside the dying man he was with before, and go on with his prayers.
      <i>Ventrebleu!</i> that's what I call discipline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was that, Comrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Elkankah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Quoreyn, rather, my friend, two leagues to the southward,&rdquo; whispered a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tonnerre de ciel!</i>&rdquo; cried the two soldiers in a breath, &ldquo;it is
      himself;&rdquo; for the words were spoken by the priest, who was no other than
      the Père Arsène they spoke of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effort of speech and memory was, however, a mere passing one; for to
      all their questions he was now deaf, and lay apparently unconscious
      between them. On me, therefore, they turned their inquiries, but with
      little more of success; and thus we descended the mountain, eager to reach
      some place of succor for the good father.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we approached the village, I was soon made aware of the objects of the
      party who occupied it. The little street was crowded with cattle,
      bullocks, and sheep, fast wedged up amid huge wagons of forage and carts
      of corn; mounted dragoons urging on the jaded animals, regardless of the
      angry menaces or the impatient appeals incessantly making by the
      peasantry, who in great numbers had followed their stock from their farms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0016" id="linkimage-0016">

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/page221.jpg" alt="Browneforagingparty221 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      The soldiers, who were detachments of different corps, were also
      quarrelling among themselves for their share of the spoil; and these
      altercations, in which more than once I saw a sabre flash, added to the
      discord. It was, indeed, a scene of tumult and confusion almost
      inconceivable. Here were a party of cuirassiers, carbine in hand,
      protecting a drove of sheep; around which the country people were
      standing, seemingly irresolute whether they should essay an attack,&mdash;a
      movement often prompted by the other soldiers, who hoped in the <i>mêlée</i>
      to seize a part of the prey. Many of the oxen were bestrode by hussars or
      lancers, whose gay trappings formed a strange contrast with the beasts
      they rode on; while more than one stately horseman held a sheep before him
      on the saddle, for whose protection a cocked pistol seemed no ineffectual
      guarantee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The task of penetrating this dense and turbulent mob seemed to me almost
      impossible, and I expressed my fears to the soldiers. But they replied
      that there were too many <i>braves</i> of Egypt there not to remember the
      Père Arsène; saying which, one of the soldiers, whispering a word to his
      companion, laid the priest gently upon the ground, and then mounting
      rapidly on a forage-cart, he shouted, in a voice heard above the din,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comrades of the Fourth, we have found an old companion; the Père
      Scapulaire is here. Place for the good father! place there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hundred loud <i>vivas</i> welcomed this announcement; for the name was
      well known to many who never had seen the priest, and cheer after cheer
      for the <i>bon père</i> now rang through this motley assemblage.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the wild confusion of a moment before the regularity of discipline at
      once succeeded, and a lane was quickly formed for the soldiers to advance
      with the priest between them, each horseman saluting as he passed as if to
      his general on parade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Trauben,&mdash;the Trauben!&rdquo; cried several voices, as we went
      along; and this I learned was the little inn of the village, where the
      non-commissioned officers in charge of the several parties were seated in
      council to arrange the subdivision of the booty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had not a feeling stronger than mere personal consideration occupied me, I
      would have now left the good priest among his old comrades, with whom he
      was certain to meet kindness and protection. But I could not so readily
      part with one whom, even in the few hours of our intercourse, I had
      learned to like; and therefore, enduring as well as I was able the rugged
      insubordination of a soldiery free from the restraint of discipline, I
      followed on, and soon found myself at the door of the Trauben.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dismounted dragoon, with drawn sword, guarded the entrance, around which
      a group of angry peasants were gathered, loudly protesting against the
      robbery of their flocks and farmyards. It was with great difficulty I
      could persuade the sentry to suffer me to enter; and when I at last
      succeeded, I found none willing to pay any attention to my request
      regarding a billet for the priest, for unhappily his name and character
      were unknown to those to whom I addressed myself. In this dilemma I was
      deliberating what step to take, when one of the soldiers, who with such
      zealous devotion had never left us, came up to say that his corporal had
      just given up his own quarters for the good father's use; and this,
      happily, was a small summer-house in the garden at the back of the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot come with us himself,&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;for he is engaged
      with the forage rations, but I have got his leave to take the quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A small wicket beside the inn led us into a large, wildly-grown orchard,
      through which a broad path led to the summer-house in question; at least
      such we guessed to be the little building from whose windows there gleamed
      the bright glare of a cheerful fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door lay open into a little hall, from which two doors led into
      different chambers. Over one of these was marked in chalk
      &ldquo;quartier-général,&rdquo; in imitation of the title assigned to a general's
      quarters, and this the soldiers pronounced must belong to the corporal. I
      opened it accordingly and entered. The room was small and neatly
      furnished, and with the blazing wood upon the hearth, looked most
      comfortable and inviting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we are all right here; I know his helmet,&mdash;this is it,&rdquo; said
      the dragoon. &ldquo;So here we must leave you. You'll tell the good father it
      was two troopers of the Fourth who carried him hither, won't ye? Ay, and
      say Auguste Prévôt was one of them; he 'll know the name,&mdash;he nursed
      me in a fever I had in Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he were able to give me his blessing again,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;I
      had it before that affair at Brescia, and there were four of my comrades
      killed about me, and never a shot touched me. But good-night, Comrade;
      goodnight.&rdquo; And so saying, having left the father at his length upon a
      couch, they made their military salute and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rude-looking flagon of beer which stood on the table was the only thing
      I could discover in the chamber, save a canvas bag of tobacco and some
      pipes. I filled a goblet with the liquor and placed it to the priest's
      lips. He swallowed a little of it, and then opening his eyes, slowly
      looked around him, while he murmured to my question a faint sound of
      &ldquo;Better,&mdash;much better.&rdquo; I knew enough of such matters to be aware
      that perfect rest and repose were the greatest aids to his recovery; and
      so, replenishing the fire, I threw myself down on the large dragoon cloak
      which lay on the floor, and prepared to pass my night where I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long-drawn breathings of the sleeping man, the perfect quiet and
      stillness of all around,&mdash;for though not far distant from the
      village, the thick wood of trees intercepted every sound from that
      quarter,&mdash;and my fatigue combined, soon brought on drowsiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I struggled, so long as I was able, against the tendency; but a humming
      sound filled my ears, the objects grew fainter before my vision, and I
      sank into that half-dreamy state when consciousness remains, but clouded
      and indistinct in all its perceptions. Twice the door was opened and some
      persons entered; but though they spoke loudly, I heard not their words,
      nor could I recognize their appearance. To this succeeded a deep, sound
      sleep, the recompense of great fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The falling of a piece of firewood on the hearth awoke me. I opened my
      eyes and looked about. The room had no other light than from the embers of
      the wood fire and the piece of blazing pine which had just fallen; but
      even by that uncertain glare I could see enough to amaze and confuse me.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the couch where I had left the priest sleeping, the old man was now
      seated, his head uncovered, and a scarf of light blue silk across his
      shoulders and falling to his feet. Before him, and kneeling, was a figure,
      of which for some minutes I in vain endeavored to ascertain the traits;
      for while in the military air of the dress there was something to mark the
      soldier, a waving mass of hair loosely falling on the back bespoke another
      sex. While I yet doubted, the flickering flame burst forth and showed me
      the small and beautiful shaped foot which from beneath a loose trouser
      peeped forth, and in the neat boot and tastefully ornamented spur I
      recognized in an instant it was a vivandière of the army,&mdash;one of
      those who, amid all the reckless abandon of the life of camps and
      battlefields, can yet preserve some vestige of coquetry and feminine
      grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      So strange the sight, so complete the heavy stupor of my faculties, that
      again and again I doubted whether the whole might not be the creation of a
      dream; but the well-known tones of the old man's voice soon reassured me,
      as I heard him say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it too, my child; I have followed too long the fortunes of an army
      not to feel and to sorrow for these things. But be comforted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A passionate burst of tears from her who knelt at his feet interrupted him
      here; nor did it seem that all he could speak of consolation was able to
      assuage the deep sorrow of the poor girl, whose trembling frame bespoke
      her agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees, however, she grew calmer. A deep sob or a long-drawn sigh
      alone would be heard, as the venerable father, with impassioned eloquence,
      depicted the happiness of those who sought the blessings of religion, and
      could tear themselves from the world and its ambitions. Warming with his
      theme, he descanted on the lives of those saints on earth whose every
      minute was an offering of heavenly love; and contrasted the holy calm of a
      convent with the wild revelry of the camp, or the more revolting carnage
      of the battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak not of these things, Father; your own voice trembles with proud
      emotion at the mention of glorious war. Tell me, oh! tell me that I may
      have hope, and yet leave not all that makes life endurable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man spoke again; but his tones were low, and his words seemed a
      reproof, for she bowed her head between her hands and sobbed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the long and impassioned appeal of the priest there now succeeded a
      silence, only broken by the deep-drawn sighs of her who knelt in sadness
      and penitence before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his name?&rdquo; said the father; &ldquo;you have not told his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause followed, in which not even a breathing was heard; then a low,
      murmuring sound came, and it seemed to meas though I heard my own name
      uttered. I started at the sound, and with the noise the vivandière sprang
      to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard a noise there,&rdquo; said she, resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my companion of the journey,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;Poor fellow! he is
      tired and weary; he sleeps soundly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know you had a fellow-traveller, Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we met in the Creutz Mountains, and since that» have wended our way
      together. A soldier&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A soldier! Is he wounded, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my child; he is leaving the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leaving the army, and not wounded! He is old and disabled, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither; he is both young and vigorous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame on him, then, that he turn his back on fame and fortune, and leave
      the path that brave men tread! He never was a soldier! No, Father; he in
      whose heart the noble passion once has lived can never forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, child, hush!&rdquo; said the priest, motioning with his hand to her to be
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me look on him!&rdquo; said the vivandière, as she stooped down and took
      from the hearth a piece of lighted wood; &ldquo;let me see this man, and learn
      the features of one who can be so craven of spirit, so poor of heart, as
      to fly the field, while thousands are flocking towards it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burning with shame and indignation, I arose, just as she approached me.
      The pine-branch threw its red gleam over her bright uniform, and then upon
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minette! Minette!&rdquo; I exclaimed. But with a wild shriek she let fall the
      burning wood, and fell senseless to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before, with all our care, she recovered consciousness;
      and even then, in her wild, excited glance, one might read the struggles
      of her mind to credit what had occurred. A few broken, unconnected phrases
      would escape her at intervals; and she seemed laboring to regain the lost
      clew to her recollections, when again she turned her eyes towards me. At
      the same instant, the trumpet sounded without for the <i>réveil</i>, and
      was answered by many a call from other parties around. With a steadfast
      gaze of wonderment she fixed her look on me; and twice passed her hands
      across her eyes, as though she doubted the evidence of her senses.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minette, hear me! let me speak but one word.&rdquo; &ldquo;There it is again,&rdquo; cried
      she, as the blast rang out a second time, and the clatter of horsemen
      resounded from the street. &ldquo;Adieu, sir; our roads lie not together.
      Father, your blessing; if your good counsel this night has not made its
      way to my heart, the lesson has come elsewhere. Good-by! good-by!&rdquo; She
      pressed the old man's hand to her lips, and darted from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stunned, and like one spell-bound, I could not move for a few seconds; and
      then, with a wild cry, I bounded after her through the garden. The wicket,
      however, was fastened on the outside, and it was some time before I could
      scale the wall and reach the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was just breaking, but already the village was thronged with
      soldiers, who were preparing for the march, and arranging their parties to
      conduct the wagons. Hurrying on through the crowded and confused mass, I
      looked on every side for the vivandière; but in vain. Groups of different
      regiments passed and repassed me; but to my questions they returned either
      a jeering reply, or a mere laugh of derision. &ldquo;But a few days ago,&rdquo;
       thought I, &ldquo;and these fellows had scarce dared to address me; and now&mdash;&rdquo;
       Oh, the blighting misery of that thought! I was no longer a soldier; the
      meanest horseman of his troop was my superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed through the village, and reached the highroad. Before me was a
      party of dragoons, escorting a drove of cattle; I hastened after them, but
      on coming near, discovered they were a light cavalry detachment. Sick at
      heart, I leaned against a tree at the wayside, when again I heard the
      tramp of horses approaching. I looked, and saw the tall helmets of the
      Fourth, who were coming slowly along, conducting some large wagons, drawn
      by eight or ten horses. In front of the detachment rode a man, whose
      enormous stature made him at once remarkable, as well as the air of
      soldierly bearing he displayed. Beside him was Minette; the reins had
      fallen on her horse's neck, and her face was buried in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if I had thought that priest would have made thee so sad,
      Mademoiselle, I'd have let him spend his night beneath a wagon rather than
      in my quarters,&rdquo; said a deep, hollow voice I at once recognized as that of
      Pioche. &ldquo;But the morning air will revive thee; so let us forward: by
      threes&mdash;open order&mdash;trot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word was obeyed; the heavy tramp of the horses, with the dull roll of
      the wagons, drowned all other sounds The cortège moved on, and I was
      alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. THE PENSION DE LA RUE MI-CARÊME.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I returned to the garden, I found that the Père Arsène was seized by
      an access of that dreadful malady, whose intervals of comparative release
      are but periods of dread or despondence. The tertian of Egypt, so fatal
      among the French troops, now numbered him among its victims, and he looked
      worn and exhausted, like one after weeks of illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first care was to present myself to the official whose business it was
      to inspect the passports, and by explaining the condition of my poor
      friend, to entreat permission to delay my journey,&mdash;at least until he
      should be somewhat recovered. The gruff old sergeant, however,
      deliberately examined my passport, and as rigidly decided that I could not
      remain. The words of the minister were clear and definite,&mdash;&ldquo;Day by
      day, without halt, to the nearest frontier of France,&rdquo; was the direction;
      and with this I must comply. In vain I assured him that no personal
      convenience, no wish of my own, urged the request, but the duty of
      humanity towards a fellow-traveller, and one who had strong claims on
      every soldier of the Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him to me, Monsieur,&rdquo; was the only reply I could obtain; and the
      utmost favor he would grant was the permission to take leave of my poor
      friend before I started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid all the sufferings of his malady, I found the good priest dwelling in
      his mind on the scene with the vivandière,&mdash;which, perhaps, from the
      impressionable character of a sick man's temperament, had entirely filled
      his thoughts; and thus he wandered from the subject of his sorrows to
      hers, with scarcely a transition between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I mentioned the necessity of our parting, he seemed to feel it more
      on my account than his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to have reached Paris with you,&rdquo; he repeated over and over. &ldquo;It
      was not impossible I could have arranged your return home. But you must go
      down to Sèvres,&mdash;the priest there, whoever he may be, will know of
      me; tell him everything without reserve. I am too ill to write, but if I
      get better soon&mdash;Well, well; that poor girl is an orphan too; and
      Alphonse was an orphan. With what misery have we struggled in France since
      this man has ruled our destinies! how have the crimes of a people brought
      their retribution to every heart and every home!&mdash;none too low, none
      too humble, to feel them. Leave this land; no blessing can rest upon it
      now. Poor thing! how worthy of a better lot she is! If this same officer
      should know,&mdash;it is not impossible. But, why do I say this? No, no;
      you'll never meet him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued to mutter thus some broken and disjointed sentences,
      half-aloud, for some minutes, apparently unconscious of my presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in a regiment of the Guard. Alas! she told me which, but I forget
      it now; but his name, surely I remember his name! Well, well, it is a sad
      story. Adieu, my dear child! good-by! We have each a weary road before us;
      but my journey, although the longest, will be soonest accomplished. Do not
      forget my words to you. Your own country, and your country's cause, above
      every other; all else is the hireling's part. The sense of duty alone can
      sustain a man in the trials which fit him for this world, or that better
      one which is to follow. Adieu!&rdquo; He threw his arm around me as he said
      this, and leaned exhausted and faint upon my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The few who journey through life with little sympathy or friendship from
      their fellow-men, may know how it rent my heart to part with one to whom I
      clung every hour closer; my throat swelled and throbbed, and I could only
      articulate a faint good-by as we parted. As the door was closing, I heard
      his voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have it now; I remember it well,&mdash;'Le Capitaine Burke.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started in amazement, for during all our intercourse he had never asked
      nor had I told my name, and I stood unable to speak; when he continued,&mdash;&ldquo;You
      'll think of the name,&mdash;she said, too, he was on the staff,&mdash;'Burke!'
      Poor girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not wait for more, but like one flying from some dreaded enemy I
      rushed through the garden, and gained the road, my heart torn with many a
      conflicting thought; the bitterest of all being the memory of Minette, the
      orphan girl, who alone of all the world cared for me. Oh! if strong,
      deep-rooted affection, the love of a whole heart, can raise the spirit
      above the every-day contentions of the world,&mdash;can ennoble thought,
      refine sentiments, and divest life of all its meaner traits, making a path
      of flowers among the rocks and briers of our worldly pilgrimage; so does
      the possession of affection for which we cannot give requital throw a
      gloom over the soul, for which there is no remedy. Better, a thousand
      times better, had I borne all the solitary condition of my lot, unrelieved
      by one token of regard, than think of her who had wrecked her fortunes on
      my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      With many a sad thought I plodded onward. The miles passed over seemed
      like the events in some troubled dream; and of my journey I have not a
      recollection remaining. It was late in the evening when I reached the
      Barrière de l'Étoile, and entered Paris. The long lines of lamps along the
      quays, the glittering reflection in the calm river, the subdued but
      continual hum of a great city, awoke me from my reverie, and I bethought
      me that my career of life must now begin anew, and all my energies must be
      called on to fashion out my destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning after my arrival I presented myself, in compliance with the
      requisite form, before the minister of police. Little information of mine
      was necessary to explain the circumstances under which I was placed. He
      was already thoroughly acquainted with the whole, and seemed in nowise
      disposed to evince any undue lenity towards one who had voluntarily
      quitted the service of the Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you purpose to remain, sir?&rdquo; said the préfet, as he concluded a
      lengthened and searching scrutiny of my appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Paris,&rdquo; I replied, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Paris, I suppose,&rdquo; said he, with a slight derisive curl of the lip,&mdash;&ldquo;of
      that I should think there can be little doubt; but I wished to ascertain
      more accurately your address,&mdash;in what part of the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As yet I cannot tell; I am almost a stranger here. A day or two will,
      however, enable me to choose, and then I shall return here with the
      intelligence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is sufficient, sir; I shall expect to see you soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand in sign to me to withdraw, and I was but too happy to
      follow the indication. As I hastened down the stairs, and forced my way
      through the crowd of persons who awaited an audience with the préfet, I
      heard a voice close to my ear whisper, &ldquo;A word; one word with you,
      Monsieur.&rdquo; Conceiving, however, it could not have been intended for me, to
      whom no face there was familiar, I passed on, and reached the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of footsteps rapidly moving on the grave behind me induced me to
      turn; and I beheld a small, miserably-dressed man, whose spare and wasted
      form bespoke the sorest trials of poverty, advancing towards me, hat in
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you deign me one word, Monsieur?&rdquo; said he, in a voice whose tone,
      although that of entreaty, was yet remote from the habitual accent of one
      asking alms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must mistake me,&rdquo; said I, desirous to pass on; &ldquo;I am unknown to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, sir; but it is as a stranger I take the liberty of addressing you.
      I heard you say just now that you had not fixed on any place of abode in
      Paris; now, if I might venture to entreat your preference for this
      establishment, it would be too much honor for me, its poor master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he placed in my hands a small card, inscribed with the words,
      &ldquo;Pension Bourgeoise, Rue de Mi-Carême, Boulevard Mont Parnasse, No. 46,&rdquo;
       at top; and beneath was a paragraph, setting forth the economical fact
      that a man might eat, drink, and sleep for the sum of twelve francs a
      week, enjoying the delights of &ldquo;agreeable society, pleasant environs, and
      all the advantages of a country residence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with difficulty I could avoid a smile at the shivering figure who
      ventured to present himself as an inducement to try the fare of his house.
      Whether my eyes did wander from the card to his countenance, or any other
      gesture of mine betrayed my thoughts, the old man seemed to divine what
      was passing in my mind, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur will not pronounce on the 'pension' from the humble guise of its
      master. Let him but try it; and I promise that these poor rags, this
      miserable figure, has no type within the walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a tone of deep dejection, mingled with a sense of conscious
      pride, in which he said these few words, that at once decided me not to
      grieve him by a refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may count on me, then, Monsieur,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;My stay here is so far
      uncertain, that it depends not altogether on myself; but for the present I
      am your guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took my purse from my pocket as I spoke, knowing the custom in these
      humbler boarding-houses was to pay in advance; but the old man reddened
      slightly, and motioned with his hand a refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is a captain in the Guards,&rdquo; said he, proudly; &ldquo;no more is
      necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistake, friend, I am no longer so; I have left the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left it, <i>en retraite?</i>&rdquo; said he, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so; left it at my own free will and choice. And now, perhaps, I had
      better tell you, that as I may not enjoy any considerable share of
      goodwill from the police authorities here, my presence might be less
      acceptable to your other guests, or to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man's eyes sparkled as I spoke, and his lips moved rapidly, as
      though he were speaking to himself; then, taking my hand, he pressed it to
      his lips, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur could not be more welcome than at present. Shall we expect you
      to-day at dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so. Your hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four o'clock, to the moment. Do not forget the number, 46 Monsieur
      Rubichon; the house with a large garden in front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till then,&rdquo; said I, bowing to my host, whose ceremonious politeness made
      me feel my own salute an act of rudeness in comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I parted from the old man, I was glad at the relief to my own thoughts
      which even thus much of speculation afforded, and sauntered on, fancying
      many a strange conceit about the &ldquo;pension&rdquo; and its inhabitants. At last
      the hour drew near; and having placed my few effects in a cabriolet, I set
      out for the distant boulevard of Mont Parnasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remarked with pleasure, that as we went along the streets and
      thoroughfares became gradually less and less crowded; scarcely a carriage
      of any kind was to be met with. The shops were, for the most part, the
      quiet, unpretending-looking places one sees in a provincial town; and an
      air of peacefulness and retirement prevailed, strongly at variance with
      the clamor and din of the heart of the capital. This was more than ever so
      as we emerged upon the boulevard itself: on one side of which houses, at
      long straggling intervals, alone were to be seen; at the other, the
      country lay open to the view, with its orchards and gardens, for miles
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Saprelotte!</i>&rdquo; said the driver, who, like so many of his calling,
      was a blunt son of Alsace,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>saprelotte!</i> we have come to the
      end of the world here. How do you call the strange street you are looking
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Rue de Mi-Carême.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mi-Carême? I 'd rather you lived there than me; that name does not
      promise much in regard to good feeding. Can this be it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he pointed with his whip to a narrow, deserted-looking street,
      which opened from the boulevard. The houses were old and dilapidated, but
      stood in small gardens, and seemed like the remains of the villa
      residences of the Parisians in times long past. A few more modern
      edifices, flaring with red brick fronts, were here and there scattered
      amongst them; but for all the decay and dismantlement of the others, they
      seemed like persons of rank and condition in the company of their
      inferiors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few of the larger houses were inhabited. Large placards, &ldquo;à louer,&rdquo; on the
      gateways or the broken railings of the garden, set forth the advantages of
      a handsome residence, situated between court and garden; but the falling
      roofs and broken windows were in sad discordance with the eulogy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unaccustomed noise of wheels, as we went along, drew many to the doors
      to stare at us, and in the gathering groups I could mark the astonishment
      so rare a spectacle as a cabriolet afforded in these secluded parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the Rue Mi-Carême?&rdquo; said the driver to a boy, who stood gazing in
      perfect wonderment at our equipage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; muttered the child,&mdash;&ldquo;yes. Who are you come for now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come for, my little man? Not for any one. What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was the commissary,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>sapperment!</i> I knew we were in a droll neighborhood,&rdquo; murmured
      the driver. &ldquo;It would seem they never see a cabriolet here except when it
      brings the <i>commissaire de police</i> to look after some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If this reflection did not tend to allay my previous doubts upon the
      nature of the locality, it certainly aided to excite my curiosity, and I
      was determined to persist in my resolution of at least seeing the interior
      of the &ldquo;pension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are at last,&rdquo; cried the driver, throwing down his whip on the
      horse's back, as he sprang to the ground, and read aloud from a board
      fastened to a tree, &ldquo;'Pension Bourgeoise. M. Rubichon, propriétaire.'
      Shall I wait for monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Take out that portmanteau and cloak; I'm not going back now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stare of most undisguised astonishment was the only reply he made, as he
      took forth my baggage, and placed it at the little gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 'll be coming home at night,&rdquo; said he, at length; &ldquo;shall I come to
      fetch you? Not to-night,&rdquo; repeated he, in amazement. &ldquo;Well, adieu,
      Monsieur,&mdash;you know best; but I 'd not come a-pleasuring up here, if
      I was a young fellow like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he drove away, I turned to look at the building before me, which up to
      this time I had not sufficiently noted. It was a long, two-storied house,
      which evidently at an early period had been a mansion of no mean
      pretension. The pilasters which ornamented the windows, the balustrades of
      the parapet, and the pediment above the entrance, were still remaining,
      though in a dilapidated condition. The garden in front showed also some
      signs of that quaint taste originally borrowed from the Dutch, and the
      yew-trees still preserved some faint resemblance to the beasts and animals
      after which they had once been fashioned, though time and growth had
      altered the outlines, and given to many a goodly lion or stag the bristly
      coat of a porcupine. A little fountain, which spouted from a sea-monster's
      nostrils, was grass-grown and choked with weeds. Everything betokened
      neglect and ruin; even the sundial had fallen across the walk, and lay
      moss-grown and forgotten; as though to say that Time had no need of a
      record there. The <i>jalousies</i>, which were closed in every window,
      permitted no view of the interior; nor did anything, save a faint curl of
      light blue smoke from one chimney, give token of habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help smiling to myself at the absurd fancy which had suffered
      me to feel that this deserted quarter, this lonesome dwelling, contained
      anything either adventurous or strange about it, or that I should find
      either in the &ldquo;pension&rdquo; or its guests wherewithal to interest or amuse me.
      With this thought I opened the wicket, and, crossing the garden, pulled
      the bell-rope that hung beside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep clanging echoed again and again to my summons, and ere it ceased
      the door was opened, and M. Rubichon himself stood before me: no longer,
      however, the M. Rubichon of the morning, in garments of worn and tattered
      poverty, but attired in a suit which, if threadbare, was at least clean
      and respectable-looking,&mdash;a white vest, and ruffles also, added to
      the air of neatness of his costume; and whether from his own deserts, or
      my surprise at the transformation, he seemed to me to possess the look and
      bearing of a true gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having welcomed me with the well-bred and easy politeness of one who knew
      the habits of society, he gave orders to a servant girl to conduct me to a
      room, adding, &ldquo;May I beg of monsieur to make a rapid toilet, for the
      dinner will be served in less than ten minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The M. Rubichon of the morning no more prepared me for that gentleman at
      evening than did the ruinous exterior of the dwelling for the neat and
      comely chamber into which I was now installed. The articles of furniture
      were few, but scrupulously clean; and the white curtains of the little
      bed, the cherry-wood chairs, the table, with its gray marble top,&mdash;all
      were the perfection of that propriety which gives even to humble things a
      look of elegance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had but time to make a slight change in my dress when the bell sounded
      for dinner, and at the same instant a gentle knock came to my door. It was
      M. Rubichon, come to conduct me to the <i>salle</i>, and anxious to know
      if I were satisfied with my chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In summer, Monsieur, if we shall have the happiness of possessing you
      here at that season, the view of the garden is delightful from this
      window; and,&mdash;you have not noticed it, of course, but there is a
      little stair, which descends from the window into the garden, which you
      will find a great convenience when you wish to walk. This way, now. We are
      a small party to-day, and indeed shall be for a few weeks. What name shall
      I have the honor to announce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! an Irish name,&rdquo; said he, smiling, as he threw open the door of a
      spacious but simply furnished apartment, in which about a dozen persons
      were standing or sitting around the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help remarking, that as Monsieur Rubichon presented me to his
      other guests, my name seemed to meet a kind of recognition from each in
      turn. My host perceived this, and explained it at once by saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a namesake of yours amongst us; not exactly at this moment, for
      he is in Normandy, but he will be back in a week or so. Madame de Langeac,
      let me present Mr. Burke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Rubichon's guests were all persons somewhat advanced in life; and
      though in their dress evincing a most unvarying simplicity and economy,
      had yet a look of habitual good tone and breeding which could not be
      mistaken. Among these, the lady to whom I was now introduced was
      conspicuous, and in her easy and graceful reception of me, showed the
      polished manners of one accustomed to the best society.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some half-jesting observations, expressive of surprise that a young
      man&mdash;and consequently, as she deemed, a gay one&mdash;should have
      selected as his residence an unvisited quarter and a very retired house,
      she took my arm, and proceeded to the dinner-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner itself, and the table equipage, were in keeping with the
      simplicity of the whole establishment; but if the fare was humble and the
      wine of the very cheapest, all the habitudes of the very highest society
      presided at the meal, and the polished ease and elegance, so eminently the
      gift of ancient French manners, were conspicuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      There prevailed among the guests all the intimacy of a large family; at
      the same time a most courteous deference was remarkable, which never
      approached familiarity. And thus they talked lightly and pleasantly
      together of mutual friends and places they had visited; no allusion ever
      being made to the popular topics of the day,&mdash;to me a most
      inexplicable circumstance, and one which I could not avoid slightly
      expressing my astonishment at to the lady beside me. She smiled
      significantly at my remark, and merely said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so agreeable to discuss matters where there can be no great
      difference of opinion,&mdash;at least, no more than sharpens the wit of
      the speakers,&mdash;that you will rarely hear other subjects talked of
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have the great events which are yet passing no interest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they interest too deeply to admit of much discussion,&rdquo; said she,
      with some earnestness of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am myself transgressing; and, what is still worse, losing you the
      observations of Monsieur de Saint George on Madame de Sévigné.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark was evidently made to change the current of our conversation;
      and so I accepted it,&mdash;listening to the chit-chat around me, which,
      from its novelty alone, possessed a most uncommon charm to my ears. It was
      so strange to hear the allusions to the courtiers and the beauties of
      bygone days made with all the freshness of yesterday acquaintance; and the
      stores of anecdotes about the court of Louis the Fifteenth and the Regency
      told with a piquancy that made the event seem like an occurrence of the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we retired to the drawing-room for coffee, I saw that the &ldquo;pension&rdquo;
       was a Royalist establishment, and wondered how it happened that I should
      have been selected by the host to make one of his guests. Yet
      unquestionably there seemed no reserve towards me; on the contrary, each
      evinced a tone of frankness and cordiality which made me perfectly at
      ease, and well satisfied at the fortune which led me to the Rue Mi-Carême.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little parties of dominoes and piquet scattered through the <i>salon</i>;
      some formed groups to converse; the ladies resumed their embroidery; and
      all the occupations of indoor life were assumed with a readiness that
      betokened habit, and gave to the &ldquo;pension&rdquo; the comfortable air of a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus passed the first evening. The next morning the party assembled at an
      early hour to breakfast; after which the gentlemen went out, and did not
      appear until dinnertime,&mdash;day succeeding day in unvarying but to me
      not unpleasing monotony. I rarely wandered from the large wilderness of a
      garden near the house, and saw weeks pass over without a thought ever
      occurring to me that life must not thus be suffered to ebb.

      CHAPTER XXIX. MY NAMESAKE
    </h2>
    <p>
      About a month after I came to live in the &ldquo;pension,&rdquo; I was sitting one
      evening at the window, watching, with the interest an idle man will ever
      attach to slight things,&mdash;the budding leaves of an early spring,&mdash;when
      I heard a step approach my chair, and on turning my head perceived Madame
      de Langeac. She carried her taboret in her hand, and came slowly towards
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come to steal some of your sunshine, Monsieur Burke,&rdquo; said the old
      lady, smiling good-naturedly, as I rose to present a chair, &ldquo;but not to
      drive you away, if you will be generous enough to keep me company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stammered out some commonplace civility in reply, and was silent, for my
      thoughts were bent upon my future, and I was ill disposed to interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fond of flowers, I have remarked,&rdquo; continued she, as if
      perceiving my preoccupation, and willing to relieve it by taking the
      burden of the conversation. &ldquo;And it is a taste I love to witness; it seems
      to me like the evidence of a homely habit. It is only in childhood we
      learn this love; we may cultivate it in after life as we will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother was passionately fond of them,&rdquo; said I, calling up a
      long-buried memory of home and kindred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. These simple tastes are the inheritance a mother gives her
      child; and happily they survive every change of fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sighed heavily as she spoke, for thus accidentally was touched the
      weakest chord of my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, better still,&rdquo; resumed she, &ldquo;they are the links that unite us to the
      past, that bind the heart of manhood to infancy, that can bring down pride
      and haughtiness, and call forth guileless affection and childlike faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are happy,&rdquo;' said I, musing, &ldquo;who can mingle such early memories
      with the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who cannot?&rdquo; interrupted she, rapidly. &ldquo;Who has not felt the love of
      parents,&mdash;the halo of a home? Old as I am, even I can recall the
      little walks I trod in infancy, and the hand that used to guide me. I can
      bring up the very tones of that voice which vibrated on my heart as they
      spoke my name. But how much happier they to whom these memories are linked
      with tokens of present affection, and who, in their manhood's joys, can
      feel a father's or a mother's love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was left an orphan when a mere child,&rdquo; said I, as though the
      observation had been specially addressed to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have brothers,&mdash;sisters, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head. &ldquo;A brother, indeed; but we have never met since we were
      children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet your country has not suffered the dreadful convulsion of ours; no
      social wreck has scattered those who once lived in close affection
      together. It is sad when such ties are broken. You came early to France, I
      think you told me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame. When a mere child my heart conceived a kind of devotion to
      the Emperor: his fame, his great exploits, seemed something more than
      human,&mdash;filled every thought of my brain; and to be a soldier,<i>his</i>
      soldier, was the limit of my ambition. I fancied, too, that the cause he
      asserted was that of freedom; that liberty, universal liberty, was the
      watchword that led to victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have discovered your error,&rdquo; interrupted she. &ldquo;Alas! it were
      better to have followed the illusion. A faith once shaken leaves an
      unsettled spirit, and with such there is little energy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And less of hope,&rdquo; said I, despondingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, if there be youth. Come, you must tell me your story. It is from
      no mere curiosity I ask you; but that I have seen much of the world, and
      am better able than you to offer counsel and advice. I have remarked, for
      some time past, that you appear to have no acquaintance in Paris,&mdash;no
      friend. Let me be such. If the confidence have no other result, it will
      relieve your heart of some portion of its burden; besides, the others here
      will learn to regard you with less distrust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is such their feeling towards me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me; I did not exactly use the word I sought for. But now that I
      have ventured so far, I may as well confess that you are an object of the
      greatest interest in their eyes; nor can they divest themselves of the
      impression that some deep-laid plot had led you hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I known this before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had left us. I guessed as much: I have remarked it in your character
      already, that a morbid dread of being suspected is ever uppermost in your
      thoughts; and accounted for it by supposing that you might have been
      thrown at too early an age into life. But you must not feel angry with us
      here. As for me, I have no merit in my right appreciation of you: Monsieur
      Rubichon told me how you met,&mdash;a mere accident, at the bureau of the
      préfet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so; nor have I been able to divine why he addressed himself to me,
      nor what circumstance could have led him to believe my sentiments in
      accordance with those of his guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple enough the reason. He heard from your own lips you were a
      stranger, without any acquaintance in Paris. The police for a time have
      been somewhat frequent in their visits here, when the exclusively Royalist
      feature of the 'pension' excited some dissatisfaction. To overcome the
      impression, M. Rubichon determined to wait each day at the bureau of the
      préfet, and solicit at hazard among the persons there to patronize his
      house. We all here consented to the plan, feeling its necessity. Our good
      fortune sent us you. Still, you must not be surprised if long sorrows and
      much suffering have engendered suspicion, nor that the old followers of a
      king look distrustfully on the soldier of&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated and blushed
      slightly, then added, in a low voice&mdash;&ldquo;of the Emperor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word seemed to have cost a pang in its utterance; for she did not
      speak for several minutes after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these gentlemen,&mdash;am I to conclude that they cherish
      disaffection to the present Government, or harbor a hope of its downfall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether some accidental expression of disdain escaped me as I said this, I
      cannot say; but Madame de Langeao quickly replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are good Frenchmen, sir, and loyal gentlemen; what they <i>hope</i>
      must be a matter for their own hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat your pardon, Madame, if I have said one syllable which could
      reflect upon their motives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you readily,&rdquo; said she, smiling courteously; &ldquo;he who has worn a
      sabre so long, may well deem its influence all-powerful. But believe me,
      young man, there is that within the heart of a nation against which mere
      force is nothing; opposed to it, armed squadrons and dense ranks are
      powerless. Devotion to a sovereign, whose claim comes hallowed by a long
      line of kings, is a faith to which religion lends its sanction and
      tradition its hope. Look on these very persons here; see, has adversity
      chilled their affection, or poverty damped their ardor? You know them not;
      but I will tell you who they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, at the fire, that venerable old man with the high, bold forehead,
      he is Monsieur de Plessis (Comte Plessis de Riancourt). His grandfather
      entertained Louis the Fourteenth and his suite within his château; he
      himself was grand falconer to the king. And what is he now? I shame to
      speak it,&mdash;a fencing-master at an humble school of the Faubourg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other opposite to him (he is stooping to pick something from the
      floor), I myself saw him kneel at the levée of his Majesty, and beheld the
      king assist him to rise, as he said, 'Monsieur de Maurepas, I would make
      you a duke, but that no title could be so dear to a Maurepas as that his
      ancestors have borne for six hundred years.' And he, whose signature was
      but inferior to the royal command, copies pleadings of a lawyer to earn
      his support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that tall man yonder, who has just risen from the table,&mdash;neither
      years nor poverty have erased the stamp of nobility from his graceful
      figure,&mdash;Comte Felix d'Ancelot, captain of the Gardes du Corps; the
      same who was left for dead on the stairs at Versailles pierced by eleven
      wounds. He gives lessons in drawing! two leagues from this, at the other
      extremity of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me if they hope; what else than hope, what other comforter, could
      make such men as these live on in want and indigence, declining every
      proffer of advancement, refusing every temptation that should warp their
      allegiance? I have read of great deeds of your Emperor,&mdash;I have heard
      traits of heroism of his generals, compared to which the famed actions of
      the Crusaders paled away; but tell me if you think that all the glory ever
      won by gallant soldier, tried the courage or tested the stout heart like
      the long struggle of such men as these? And here, if I mistake not, comes
      another, not inferior to any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, the steps of a <i>calèche</i> at the door were suddenly
      lowered, and a tall and powerfully built man stepped lightly out. In an
      instant we heard his footstep in the hall, and in another moment the door
      of the <i>salon</i> opened, and M. Rubichon announced &ldquo;Le Général Count
      Burke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general had just time to divest himself of his travelling pelisse as
      he entered, and was immediately surrounded by the others, who welcomed him
      with the greatest enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la Marquise de Langeac,&rdquo; said he, approaching the old lady, as she
      sat in the recess of the window, and lifted her hand to his lips, &ldquo;I am
      overjoyed to see you in such health. I passed three days with your amiable
      cousin, Arnold de Rambuteau; who, like yourself, enjoys the happiest
      temperament and the most gifted mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you flatter thus, General,&rdquo; said Madame de Langeac, &ldquo;my young friend
      here will scarcely recognize in you a countryman,&mdash;a kinsman,
      perhaps. Let me present Mr. Burke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general's face flushed, and his eyes sparkled, as taking my hand in
      both of his own, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you indeed from Ireland? Is your name Burke? Alas! that I cannot
      speak one word of English to you. I left my country thirty-eight years
      since, and have never revisited it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general overwhelmed me with questions: first about my family, of which
      I could tell him little; and then of my own adventures, at which, to my
      astonishment, he never evinced those symptoms of displeasure I so
      confidently expected from an old follower of the Bourbons. This he
      continued to do, as he ate a hurried meal which was laid out for him in
      the <i>salon</i>; all the rest standing in a circle around, and pressing
      him with questions for this friend or that at every pause he made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, gentlemen,&rdquo; cried he, as I replied to some inquiry about my
      campaign, &ldquo;this is an instance of what I have so often spoken to you. Here
      is a youth who leaves his country solely for fighting sake; he does not
      care much for the epaulette, he cares less for the cause. Come, come,
      don't interrupt me; I know you better than you know yourself. You longed
      for the conflict and the struggle and the victory; and, <i>parbleu!</i> we
      may say as we will, but you could have scarcely made a better selection
      than with his Majesty, Emperor and King, as they style him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech met with a sorry reception from the bystanders, and in the
      dissatisfied expression of their faces, a less confident speaker might
      have read his condemnation; but the general felt not this, or, if he did,
      he effectually concealed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not inquired for Gustave de Me is in,&rdquo; said he, looking round at
      the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not seen him, surely?&rdquo; cried several together; &ldquo;we heard he was
      at Vienna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>parbleu!</i> he lives about a league from his old home,&mdash;the
      very house we spent our Christmas at eighteen years ago. They have made a
      barrack of his château, and thrown his park into a royal <i>chasse</i>;
      but he has built a hut on the river-side, and walks every day through his
      own ground, which he says he never saw so well stocked for many a year. He
      is as happy as ever, and loves to look out on the Seine before his door
      when the bright stream is rippling through many a broad leaf; ay,
      Messieurs, of good augury, too,&mdash;the lilies of France.&rdquo; He lifted a
      bumper to his lips as he spoke, and drank the toast with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden return to loyalty, so boldly announced, served to reinstate
      him in their estimation; and once again all their former pleasure at his
      appearance came back, and again the questions poured in from every
      quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the abbé,&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;what of him? Has he made up his mind yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure he has, and changed it too, at least twice every twenty-four
      hours. He is ever full of confidence and brimming with hope when the wind
      is from the eastward; but let it only come a point west, his spirits fall
      at once, and he dreams of frigates and gunboats, and the hulks in the
      Thames; and though they offered him a cardinal's hat, he 'd not venture
      out to sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warning looks of the bystanders, and even some signals to be cautious,
      here interrupted the speaker, who paused for a few seconds, and then fixed
      his eyes on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no fears, gentlemen, on that score. I know my countrymen well,
      though I have lived little among them. My namesake here may like the
      service of the Emperor better than that of a king,&mdash;he may prefer the
      glitter of the eagle to the war-cry of Saint Louis,&mdash;but he 'll never
      betray the private conversations nor expose the opinions expressed before
      him in all the confidence of social intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are speaking, Mr. Burke, of an abbé who is about to visit Ireland, and
      whose fears of the English cruisers seem little reasonable to some of my
      friends here, though you can explain, perhaps, that they are not
      groundless. I forgot,&mdash;you were but a boy when you crossed that sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he will go at last,&rdquo; said Madame de Langeac; &ldquo;I suppose we may rely
      on that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hope,&rdquo; said the general, shrugging his shoulders with an air of doubt,
      &ldquo;because, when we can do nothing else, we can always hope.&rdquo; And so saying
      he arose from the table, and taking a courteous leave of each person in
      turn, pleading the fatigue of his journey, he retired for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left the saloon soon after, and went to my room full of all I had heard,
      and pondering many thoughts about the abbé and his intended voyage. I
      spent a sleepless night. Thoughts of home, long lost in the excitement of
      my career, came flocking to my brain, and a desire to revisit my country&mdash;stronger,
      perhaps, because undefined in its object&mdash;made me restless and
      feverish. It was with delight I perceived the day dawning, and dressing
      myself hastily, I descended into the garden. To my surprise, I found
      General Burke already there. He was sauntering along slowly by himself,
      and seemed wrapped in meditation. The noise of my approach startled him,
      and he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my countryman,&mdash;so early astir?&rdquo; said he, saluting me
      courteously. &ldquo;Is this a habit of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I cannot claim the merit of such wakefulness. But last night I
      never closed my eyes. A few words you dropped in conversation in the
      drawing-room kept possession of my heart, and even yet I cannot expel
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it at the time I spoke,&rdquo; replied the general, with a keen, quick
      glance; &ldquo;you changed color twice as I mentioned the Abbé Gernon. Do you
      know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; it was his intended journey, not himself, for which I felt
      interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would wish to accompany him, perhaps. Well, the matter is not
      impossible; but as time presses, and we have little leisure for mysteries,
      tell me frankly why are you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In few words, and without a comment on any portion of my conduct, I told
      him the principal circumstances of my life, down to the decisive moment of
      my leaving the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that step,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;feeling that no career can open to me here, I
      wish to regain my own country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the general, slowly; &ldquo;it is your only course now.
      The venture is not without risk,&mdash;less from the English cruisers than
      the French, for the abbé is well known in England, and Ireland too; but
      his Royalist character would find slight favor with Fouché. You are
      willing to run the risk, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to travel as the abbe's servant, at least to Falaise? there the
      disguise will end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for this service, are you also ready to render us one in return?&rdquo;
       said he, peering at me beneath his eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it involve the good faith I once swore to preserve towards the Emperor
      Napoleon, I refuse it at once. On such a condition, I cannot accept your
      aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does your heart still linger where your pride has been so insulted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does, it does; to be his soldier once more, I would submit to
      everything but dishonor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said he, smiling good-naturedly, &ldquo;my conscience is a clear
      one; and I may forward your escape with the satisfying reflection that I
      have diminished the enemies of his Majesty Louis the Eighteenth by one
      most inveterate follower of Napoleon. I shall ask no conditions of you.
      When are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day,&mdash;now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see; to-morrow will be the 8th,&mdash;to-morrow will do. I will
      write about it at once. Meanwhile, it is as well you should not drop any
      hint of your intended departure, except to Madame de Langeac, whose
      secrecy may be relied on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you run any risk in thus befriending me? It is an
      office, believe me, of little promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever. Rarely a month passes over without some one or other
      leaving this for England. The intercourse between Rome and Ireland is
      uninterrupted, and has been so during the hottest period of the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This seems most unaccountable to me; I cannot understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a key to the mystery, however,&rdquo; said he, smiling. &ldquo;The English
      Government have confidence in the peaceful efforts of the priesthood as
      regards Ireland, and permit them to hold unlimited intercourse with the
      Holy See, which fears France and the spirit of her Emperor. The Bourbons
      look to the Church as the last hope of the Restoration. It is in the
      Catholic religion of this country, and its traditions, that monarchy has
      its root. Sap one, and you undermine the other. Legitimacy is a holy
      relic,&mdash;like any other, the priests are the guardians of it; and as
      for the present ruler of France, he trusts in the spirit of the Church to
      increase its converts, and believes that Ireland is ripening to revolt
      through the agency of the priests. Fouché alone is not deceived. Between
      him and the Church the war is to the knife; and but for him the high seas
      would be more open than the road to Strasburg,&mdash;at least, to all with
      a shaven crown and a silk frock. Here, then, is the simple explanation of
      what seemed so difficult; and I believe you will find it the true one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But two out of the three parties must be deceived,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps all three are,&rdquo; replied he, smiling sarcastically. &ldquo;There are
      some, at least, who deem the return of the rightful sovereign is more to
      be hoped from the sabre than the crosier, and think that Rome never was
      true except to Rome. As to your journey, however, its only difficulty or
      danger is the transit through France; once at the coast, and all is safe.
      Your passport shall be made out as a retired sous-officier returning to
      his home. You will take Marboeuf in the route, and I will give you the
      necessary directions for discovering the abbé.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not possible,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that <i>he</i> may feel no inclination to
      encumber himself with a fellow-traveller, and particularly one a stranger
      to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear on that head. Your presence, on the contrary, will give him
      courage, and we must let him suppose you accompany him at our suggestion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with any implied knowledge or any connection with your views,
      however,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;This is well understood between us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly so. And now meet me here this evening, after coffee, and I will
      give you your final instructions, Adieu, for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand and left me. Then, after walking a few paces, turned
      quickly round, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remember, a blouse and knapsack are indispensable for your
      equipment. Adieu!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXX. AN OLD SAILOR OF THE EMPIRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      No circumstance of any interest occurred on my journey to Marboeuf; my
      passport, made out in my own name as a sous-officier on leave, secured me
      against any interruption or delay; and on the third evening I reached the
      little wayside cabaret, about a league beyond the town, where I was
      informed by the count that the abbé would await me.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise, however, I discovered that the house was occupied by a
      detachment of the Marines of the Guard, proceeding from Marboeuf to the
      coast; with these, assuming the &ldquo;camaraderie&rdquo; of the service, I soon made
      acquaintance, and being possessed of some information about the army, my
      company was at once coveted by the sailors, who had no opportunity of
      learning the events of the campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flurried manner and the over-solicitous desire of the landlord to
      please, did not escape me; and taking the first opportunity that offered,
      I followed him into his room, and closed the door behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has <i>he</i> arrived?&rdquo; said I, assuming at once the tone of one with
      whom there need be no secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! you are the captain, then, and I was right?&rdquo; said he, not replying to
      my question, but showing that he was aware who I was. But in an instant he
      resumed, &ldquo;Alas! no, sir; the orders to have quarters ready for ten men
      reached me yesterday; and though I told his messenger that he might come
      in safety,&mdash;the marines never noticing any traveller,&mdash;he has
      evidently been afraid to venture. This is the 10th; on the 12th the vessel
      is to be off the coast; after that it will be too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he may come yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head and sighed; then muttered half aloud, &ldquo;It was a
      foolish choice to take a coward for a hazardous enterprise. The Comte de
      Chambord has been here twice to-day to see him, but in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he, then? at what distance from here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one knows. It must be some leagues away, however, for his messenger
      seems tired and weary when he comes, and never returns the same day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not possible he may have pushed on to the coast, finding this place
      occupied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sir, it is plain you know him not; he has no daring like this, and
      would never seek a new path if the old were closed against him. But after
      all, it would be useless here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letters have not come yet, and without them he could not leave the
      coast. Meanwhile, be cautious: take care lest your absence should be
      remarked by the men; return to them now, and if anything occur, I will
      make a signal for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord's advice was well timed, for I found that the party were
      already becoming impatient at my delay, and wondering what had caused it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say, Comrade,&rdquo; said a short-set, dark-featured Breton, whose black
      beard and mustache left little vestige of a human face visible,&mdash;&ldquo;they
      say that the cavalry of the Guard give themselves airs with us marines,
      and that our company is not good enough for them. Is this the case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the first time I have heard the remark,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;and I hope it
      may be the last; with us of the Eighth I know such a feeling never
      existed; and yet we thought ourselves not inferior to our neighbors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you leave us just now?&rdquo; grumbled out two or three in a
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know that presently,&rdquo; said I, smiling; at the same time I arose
      and opened the door. &ldquo;You may bring in the Burgundy now, Master Joseph; we
      are all ready for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hearty cheer welcomed this speech, and many a rude hand was stretched
      forth to grasp mine; at the same instant the host, accurately divining the
      necessity of the moment, entered with a basket containing six bottles,
      whose cobwebbed necks and crusted surface bespoke the choicest bin of his
      cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Macon!</i> gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, drawing the cork of a flask with all
      the steadiness of hand of one accustomed to treat Burgundy properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>parbleu!</i> a generous grape, too,&rdquo; said the short sailor, who
      spoke first, as he drained his glass and refilled it. &ldquo;<i>Allons</i>,
      Comrades, 'The Emperor! '&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Emperor!&rdquo; repeated each voice in turn, even to the poor landlord,
      whose caution was stronger than his loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Emperor, and may Heaven preserve him!&rdquo; said the dark-whiskered
      fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Emperor, and may Heaven forgive him!&rdquo; said the host, who this time
      uttered the true sentiments of his heart, without knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive him!&rdquo; roared three or four together,&mdash;&ldquo;forgive him what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For not making thee an admiral of the fleet,&rdquo; said the landlord, slapping
      the stout sailor familiarly on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst of rude laughter acknowledged the success of this speech, and by
      common consent the host was elected One of the company. As the wine began
      to work upon the party, the dark fellow, whose grade of sergeant was
      merely marked by a gold cord on his cuff, and which had hitherto escaped
      my notice, assumed the leadership, and recounted some stories of his life;
      which, treating of a service so novel to me in all its details, were
      sufficiently interesting, though the materials themselves were slight and
      unimportant.
    </p>
    <p>
      One feature struck me in particular through all he said, and gave a
      character most distinctive to the service he belonged to, and totally
      unlike what I had observed among the soldiers of the army. With <i>them</i>
      the armies of all Europe were accounted the enemy,&mdash;the Austrian, the
      Russian, the Italian, and the Prussian were the foes he had met and
      conquered in so many fields of glory. The pride he felt in his triumphs
      was a great but natural sentiment; involving, however, no hatred of his
      enemy, nor any desire to disparage his courage or his skill. With the
      sailor of the Empire, however, there was but one antagonist, and that one
      he detested with his whole heart: England was a word which stirred his
      passion from its very inmost recesses, and made his blood boil with
      intense excitement. The gay insolence of the soldier, treating his
      conquest as a thing of ease and certainty, had no resemblance to the
      collected and impassioned hate of the sailor, who felt that <i>his</i>
      victories were not such as proclaimed his superiority by evidence
      incontestable. The victories on land contrasted, too, so strongly with
      even what were claimed as such at sea, that the sailors could not control
      their detestation of those who had robbed them of a share of their
      country's praise, and made the hazardous career they followed one of mere
      secondary interest in the eyes of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more perfect representative of this mingled jealousy and hate could not
      be found than Paul Dupont, the sous-officier in command of this little
      party. He was a Breton, and carried the ruling trait of his province into
      the most minute feature of his conduct. Bold, blunt, courageous,
      open-hearted, and fearless, but passionate to the verge of madness when
      thwarted, and unforgiving in his vengeance when insulted, he only believed
      in Brittany, and for the rest of France he cared as little as for
      Switzerland. His whole life had been spent at sea, until about two years
      previous, when from boatswain he was promoted to be a sergeant of the
      Marines of the Guard,&mdash;a step he regretted every day, and was now
      actually petitioning to be restored to his old grade, even at the
      sacrifice of pay and rank; such was the impression a short life ashore had
      made on him, and so complete his contempt for any service save that in
      blue water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, old 'sea-wolf,'&rdquo;&mdash;such was the sobriquet Paul went by among
      his comrades,&mdash;&ldquo;thou art dull to-night,&rdquo; said an old sailor with a
      head as white as snow. &ldquo;I haven't seen thee so low of heart this many a
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wonder, Comrade, if I am so?&rdquo; retorted Paul, gruffly. &ldquo;This shore
      service is bad enough, not to make it worse by listening to such yarns as
      these we have been hearing, about platoons and squadrons; of charges here
      and counter-marches there. <i>Ventre d'enfer!</i> that may amuse those who
      never saw a broadside or a boarding; but as for me, look ye, Comrade!&rdquo;&mdash;here
      he addressed himself to me, laying his great hand upon my shoulder as he
      spoke,&mdash;&ldquo;until ye can bring your mounted lines to charge up to the
      mouth of a battery vomiting grape and roundshot, ye must not tell your
      stories before old sailors, ay, though they be only Marines' of the Guard,
      some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be angry with old Paul, Comrade,&rdquo; said the man who spoke before;
      &ldquo;he does not mean to offend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; said Paul, sternly. &ldquo;Why can't you sheer off, and
      leave me to' lay alongside of my enemy my own way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not call me by such a name,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;we all serve the Emperor,
      and have no enemies save his. Come, Paul, let us have a cup of wine
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed! an ye promise to tell no more tales of dragoons and hussars, and
      such like cattle, I'll drink with you. Bah! it's not Christianlike to
      fight a-horse-back,&mdash;it's only fit for Turks and Arabs; but for men
      that are made to stand fast on their own stout timbers, they have no need
      of four-footed beasts to carry them against an enemy. Here's my hand,
      Comrade; is it a bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said I, laughing. &ldquo;If you consent, instead, to tell us some
      of your own adventures, I promise faithfully not to trouble you with one
      of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's like a man,&rdquo; said Paul, evidently flattered by the successful
      assertion of his own superiority. &ldquo;And now, if the host will let us have
      some more wine, I'm ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; cried several together; &ldquo;replenish the basket once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time, gentlemen, you must permit me to treat you. It is not every
      day such guests assemble under my poor roof,&rdquo; said the landlord, bowing
      courteously, &ldquo;nor am I likely soon to pass so pleasant an evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's as you please it,&rdquo; said Paul, carelessly. &ldquo;If you are too good a
      fellow to care for money, there's three naps for the poor of the village;
      mayhap there may be an old sailor amongst them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of satisfaction at their comrade's conduct ran round the circle,
      as the host disappeared for the fresh supply of wine. In an instant he was
      back again, carrying a second basket under his arm, which he placed
      carefully on the table, saying, &ldquo;Pomard of '87, gentlemen; I wish it were
      Chambertin for your sakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tête bleue!</i>that's what I call wine,&rdquo; said one, smacking his lips,
      as he tasted the generous liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;that's better than drinking the pink water they serve
      us out on service. <i>Morbleu!</i> how we 'd fight, if they'd tap an aume
      of that when they beat to quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bottle now passed freely from hand to hand; and Paul, leaning back in
      his chair, crossed his arms before him, as, with his eyes half closed, he
      seemed to be occupied in remembering some long passed occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Comrades,&rdquo; said he, after a long pause, &ldquo;the landlord was not so far
      out as you may think him. I might have been, if not an admiral of the
      fleet, at least a captain or a commodore by this time, if I only wished
      it, but I wouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't, Paul?&rdquo; cried three or four in a breath. &ldquo;How do you mean,
      you wouldn't? Is it that you didn't like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it: I didn't like it,&rdquo; replied he, glaring around him as he spoke,
      with a look which had repressed any tendency to mirth, if such an
      inclination existed in the party. &ldquo;Mayhap there are some here don't
      believe this,&rdquo; he continued, as if anxious to extort a contradiction from
      any one bold enough to adventure it; but none seemed disposed to meet his
      wishes. He resumed. &ldquo;The way of it was this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sailed from Brest, seven sail and two frigates, on a cruise, in the
      Messidor of the year '13, (it was the time of the Republic then), and our
      orders were to keep together, and afford protection to all vessels of our
      flag; and wherever an opportunity offered to engage the enemy, to do so,
      if we had a fair chance of success. There was one heavy sailer of the
      fleet, the 'Old Torch,' and by good luck I was in her; and so, before we
      were eight days out, it came on to blow a hurricane from the northeast,
      with a great sea that threatened to poop us at every stroke. How the
      others weathered it I can't say; we rolled so badly that we carried away
      our mainmast and half our bulwarks, and when day broke we could see
      nothing of the rest. We were lying floundering there in the trough of the
      sea, with nothing left but a storm-jib to keep her head straight, and all
      hands at the pumps; for in working she had opened her old seams, and
      leaked like a basket. Well, we cut away the wreck of the mast, and we
      threw twelve of our guns over,&mdash;short eighteens they were, and all
      heavy metal,&mdash;and that lightened her a bit, and we began to have
      hopes of weathering out the gale, when the word was passed of a strange
      sail to windward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We looked, and there saw a great vessel looming, as large as a
      three-decker, coming down towards us with close-reefed topsails, but going
      through the water like a swordfish. At first we hoped it was one of our
      own; but that hope did not last long, for as she neared us we saw floating
      from the peak that confounded flag that never boded us good fortune. She
      was an English eighty-gun ship; the 'Blanche' they called her. <i>Ventrebleu!</i>
      I didn't know how they ever got so handsome a model; but, I learned after,
      she was a French ship, and built at Toulon,&mdash;for you see, Comrades,
      they never had such craft as ours. Well, down they came, as if they were
      about to come right over us, and never once made a signal, nor took any
      notice of us whatever, till quite close; when a fellow from the poop-deck
      shouted out in French,&mdash;bad enough it was, too,&mdash;desiring us to
      keep close till the sea went down a bit, and then to send a boat to them.
      <i>Sacristi!</i>there was no more about it than that; and they made a
      prize of us at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But our captain was not one of that mould, and he answered by beating to
      quarters; and just as the 'Blanche' swept past, up flew our ports, and
      eight carronades threw in a fire of grape along her deck that made them
      dance to the music. <i>Diable!</i> the fun was short, though. Round she
      came in stays like a pinnace, down helm, and passed us again; when, as if
      her sides slit open, forty guns flashed forth their flame, and sent us a
      broadside that made the craft tremble again, and left our deck one mass of
      dead and wounded. There was no help for it now. The clear water came
      gushing up the hatchways from many a shothole; the craft was settling
      fast, and so we hauled down the ensign and made the signal of distress.
      The answer was, 'Keep her afloat if you can.' But, faith, our fellows
      didn't care much to save a prize for the English, and they would n't lend
      a hand to the pumps, but crossed their arms and stood still, waiting for
      her to go down; when what did we see but two boats lowered from the
      'Blanche' and dropped into the sea, which was then running mountains high.
      <i>Feu d'enfer!</i> they don't know where there is danger and where not,
      these English; and that's the reason they seem so brave! For a minute or
      two we thought they were swamped, for they were hidden entirely; then we
      saw them on the top of a wave, balancing, as it might be; and again they
      disappeared, and the huge dark swell seemed to have swallowed them. And so
      we strained eyes after them, just as if our own danger was not as great as
      theirs; when suddenly a fearful cry for'ed was heard, and a voice called
      out. 'She is sinking by the head!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it was. A crash like falling timber was heard above the storm and
      the sea, and the 'Torch' rolled heavily from side to side, and then
      plunged bowsprit down, and the boiling surf met over her. There was a wild
      yell; some said it was a cheer; I thought it like a drowning cry,&mdash;and
      I remember no more. That is, I have a kind of horrid dreamy remembrance of
      buffeting in the waves, and shaking off a hand that grasped me by the
      shoulder, and then feeling the water gathering over me as I grew more and
      more exhausted. But the end of it was, I came to my senses some hours
      after, and found myself in a hammock on board the 'Blanche,' with
      twenty-eight of my comrades. All the rest&mdash;above two hundred and
      fifty&mdash;had perished, the captain and the officers among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 'Blanche' was under orders for St. Domingo, and was in no way anxious
      to have our company; and before a week was over we were drafted into a
      small sloop of war, carrying eight guns, and called the 'Fawn,' She was
      bound for England with despatches from Nelson,&mdash;one of their English
      admirals they 're always talking about. This little craft could sail like
      the wind, but she was crowded with sick and invalided men from some
      foreign station, and there was not a place the size of a dog-kennel on
      board of her that was not occupied. As for us, we were only prisoners, and
      you may think they were n't very particular about our comforts; and so
      they ranged us along under the bulwarks to leeward,&mdash;for they would
      n't spoil her sailing trim by suffering us to sit to windward; and there
      we were, drenched to the skin, and shivering from day to dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four days went over in this way, when, on the fifth, about eight o'clock
      in the morning, the lookout announced several strange sail in sight; and
      the same instant we perceived the officers setting the glasses to observe
      them. We could remark that the sight did not seem to please them much; but
      more we knew not, for we were not allowed to stand up nor look over the
      bulwarks. The lieutenant of the watch called up the commander; and when he
      came on deck he ordered the men to cram on more sail, and hold her head a
      point or so off the wind; and as soon as it was done, the rushing noise at
      the cutwater told the speed she was making through the sea. It was a fine
      day, with a fresh breeze and a nice curl from the water; and it was a
      handsome thing to see how the sloop bent to the gale and rose again, her
      canvas white as snow and steady as a board; and we soon knew, from the
      manner of the officers and the anxious looks they 'd give to leeward from
      time to time, that another vessel was in chase of the 'Fawn.' Not a man
      stirred on the deck save the lieutenant of the watch, who walked the
      quarterdeck with his glass in his hand; now lifting it to his eye, and now
      throwing a glance aloft to see how the sails were drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'She's gaining on us, sir,' cried the boatswain, as he went aloft, to the
      lieutenant. 'Shall we ease her off a little more?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, no,' said he, impatiently. 'She's coming handover-hand now. Clear
      the deck, and prepare for action.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart jumped to my throat as I heard the words; and waiting until the
      lieutenant's back was turned, I stole my eyes above the bulwark, and
      beheld the tall masts and taper spars of a frigate, all covered with
      canvas, about two miles astern of us. She was a good-sized craft,
      apparently of thirty-eight guns; but what I liked best about her was the
      broad tricolor that fluttered from her masthead. Every curl that floated
      on the breeze whispered liberty to my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You know her?' said the lieutenant, laying his hand on my shoulder,
      before I was aware he was behind me. 'What is she?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Lend me your glass, Lieutenant, and perhaps I can tell you,' said I; and
      with that he gave the telescope into my hand, and leaned on the bulwark
      beside me. 'Ha!' said I, as soon as I caught the side of her hull, 'I
      ought to know her well; I sailed in her for two years and a half. She's
      the &ldquo;Créole,&rdquo; of thirty-eight guns, the fastest frigate in our navy; she
      has six carronades on her quarterdeck, and never goes to sea without three
      hundred and twenty men.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If she had three tiers of them we 'd not flinch from her,' said a voice
      behind. It was the commander himself, who was now in full uniform, and
      wore a belt with four pistols stuck around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no use in denying it,&mdash;the English prepared for action like
      brave fellows, and soon cleared the deck of everything in the way of the
      guns. But what use was it? In less than an hour the 'Créole' worked to
      windward, and opened a fire from her long guns to which the other could
      make no reply. There they came plumping in,&mdash;some into the hull, some
      splintering through the bulwarks, and some crashing away through the
      rigging; and all the crew could do was to repair the mischief the distant
      cannonade was making.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It's a cowardly way your countrymen come into action, after all,' said
      the lieutenant, as he watched the shot hopping and skipping along the
      water to leeward. 'With four times our strength, they don't bear down and
      encourage us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he spoke, a shot cut the peak halyards in two, and down came the spar
      with a crash, carrying with it in its fall that ensign they 're so proud
      of. It was all we could do, prisoners as we were, not to cheer at this;
      but the faces around us did not encourage us to such a course, and we sat
      silently watching them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moment the accident happened, twenty stout fellows were clambering up
      the rigging, and as many more engaged to repair the mischief. But suddenly
      the commander whispered something to the lieutenant; the men were called
      down again, and the craft was let fall off the wind, trailing the sails
      and the tangled rigging over her sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And the prisoners, sir?' said the lieutenant, at the close of something
      I could not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Send them below,' was the short reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We cannot; the space between decks is crowded to suffocation. But here
      she comes.' And, as he spoke, the frigate came bearing down in gallant
      style, her whole deck swarming with men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Down, men, down!' whispered the lieutenant, and he dropped on his knee
      behind the bulwark, and motioned to the rest to kneel. And I now perceived
      that every sailor had a drawn cutlass in his hand and pistols in his belt,
      as he lay crouching on the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The frigate was now so close, I could hear the commands of the officers
      on the quarterdeck, and the words 'Bas les branles'&mdash;the signal to
      board&mdash;passed from mouth to mouth. The next instant, she closed on
      us, and showed her tall sides towering above us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now, men!' cried the commander of the 'Fawn,' 'now, forward! 'All who
      care to live, there's your ground,' said he, pointing to the frigate.
      'Such as like to die on a British deck, remain with me.' The boarders
      sprang up the side of the 'Créole' before the crew could fasten the
      grapples. <i>Tonnerre de Dieu!</i> what a moment it was! The fellows
      cheered like madmen, as they poured in to certain death; the lieutenant
      himself was one of the first on board, and fell back the same instant,
      dead upon his own deck. The struggle was a bloody but brief one; for a few
      minutes the English pressed our men back, and gained a footing on the
      quarterdeck, but a murderous fire from the tops cut them down in numbers,
      and they now fought, not for victory, but vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now, Captain, now!' screamed a youth, in a lieutenant's uniform, but all
      covered with blood, and his face gashed with a cutlass-wound, as he leaned
      over the bulwark of the 'Créole,' and waved his cap in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'm ready,' replied the English commander, and sprang down the main
      hatchway as he spoke, with a pistol in his hand. At the same instant, a
      fearful cry burst forth from the prisoners; for, with the instinct of
      despair, they guessed his desperate resolve was to blow up the vessel. We
      were tied, wrist to wrist, and the rope run through the blocks at our back
      in such a way as to prevent our moving more than a few inches. But what
      will not the fear of a dreadful death do? With one unanimous effort we
      tore the lashings in pieces, and got free. I was myself the first at
      liberty, and sprang towards the 'Creole.' Alas! they had divined the awful
      doom awaiting us, and were endeavoring to shove off at once. Already there
      were some ten or twelve feet between the vessels. I rushed forward to gain
      the bowsprit, a vague hope of escape suggesting the effort. As I did so,
      my eyes caught sight of a book, which, with his hat, the captain threw
      from him as he hastened below. I stooped down and put it in my bosom,&mdash;why,
      I know not. Life, and life only, was my thought at that moment. Then, with
      lightning's speed, I ran along the deck, and out on the bowsprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this instant, the frigate shot ahead of us; I made a leap, the last
      effort of despair, and caught the fluke of the anchor; a friendly hand
      threw me a rope and dragged me on the deck. As I gained it, a thunderclap,
      louder than ten broadsides, broke forth, and the frigate fell over on one
      side as if sinking; while over her rigging and her masts flew spars and
      timbers, blazing and burning, amid a black smoke that filled the air on
      every side. Every man about dropped wounded or terrified on the deck,
      where they lay amid the falling fire of the wreck, and the terrible
      carnage. I wiped the blood from my eyes, for I was bleeding profusely from
      a splinter cut, and looked about me. The deck was a mass of dead and
      dying; their piercing cries and groans were maddening to hear. The
      frigate, however, was flying fast through the water; the 'Fawn' was gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tête-bleue!</i> he blew her up?&rdquo; said three or four in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul nodded, and resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Comrades, and the half-dozen of her crew who stood alive on our
      quarterdeck cheered the explosion as if it was a victory; and one fellow,
      as he lay bleeding on the planks, cried out, 'See, there; look, if our gay
      flag is not high above yours, as it always will be! 'And that time he was
      right, for the spar that bore it was nigh the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to finish my story: In eight days we made Brest, and all of us who
      were wounded were sent on shore to the naval hospital. A sorry set we
      were; most of us disabled by splinter-wounds, and many obliged to suffer
      amputation. I was about again sooner than the rest, and was sent for one
      morning on board the admiral's ship, to give some account of the 'Fawn,'
      of which they never could hear enough; and when I came to that part where
      I made my escape, they all began a-laughing at my stopping to take up a
      book at such a moment. And one of the lieutenants said, jokingly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, Paul, I suppose it was the Englishman's breviary saved your life,
      was n't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, Lieutenant,' said I; 'but you 'd be mighty proud this day to have
      that same breviary in your possession.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How so, good fellow?' said the admiral himself, old Villaret Joyeuse,
      who always talked like one of ourselves. 'What is this book, then, that is
      so precious?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I 'll show it you, sir, because I 've no fear of foul play at your
      hands; but there's not another man of the fleet I 'd let see it,' And with
      that I took it out of my breast, where I always carried it, and gave it to
      him. Ah! if you'd seen his face,&mdash;how it flushed up as he turned over
      the leaves, and how his eyes sparkled with fire!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Paul Dupont,' said he, 'are you aware what this is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, Admiral,' said I, 'as well as you are.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Your fortune's made, then, my brave fellow,' said he, slapping me on the
      shoulder. 'The finest frigate in the English navy is a less prize than
      this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mille tonnerres!</i> how the others stared at me then. But I stood
      without minding how they looked, for I was the same Paul Dupont they
      laughed at a few minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile the admiral laid down the book on the table, and covered it
      with his cocked hat; and then taking a pen he wrote some lines on a piece
      of paper before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Will that do, Paul?' said he, handing it towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just this: 'Bureau of the Marine, Brest. Pay Paul Dupont the sum
      of ten thousand francs, for service rendered to his Imperial Majesty, and
      attested in a note by me Villaret Joyeuse, Admiral of France.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could scarce read the lines, Comrades, for pure passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ten thousand francs!' said I at last, as soon as I found breath,&mdash;'ten
      thousand francs!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What!' cried the admiral, 'not content? Well, then, thou shalt have
      more; but I have rarely met one of your cloth with so mercenary a spirit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Stay, Admiral,' said I, as I saw him about to write a new order; 'we
      both are in an error here. You mistake me, and I you. An old admiral of
      the fleet ought to know his sailors better than to think that money is
      their highest reward; it never was so at least with Paul Dupont Let me
      have my book again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come, come, Paul; I believe I understand you now,' laid he. 'Your
      warrant shall be made out this day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, Admiral, it's too late,' said I. 'If that had come first, and from
      yourself, all well; but it looks like a bargain now, and I 'll not have
      promotion that way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mort du diable!' said he, stamping with passion. 'But they 're all the
      same; these Bretons are as brutal in their obstinacy as their own cattle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You say true, Admiral,' said I; 'but if they're obstinate in wrong,
      they're resolute in right. You are a Breton gentleman; give me back my
      book.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Take it,' said he, flinging it at me, 'and let me never see your face
      again.' And with that he left the cabin, and banged the door after him in
      a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, I went my way, Comrades, back to my ship, and served for many a
      long year after, carrying that book always in my breast, and thinking to
      myself, 'Well, what if thou art only a boatswain, Paul; thou hast
      wherewithal in thy keeping to make thee a commodore any day.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what can it be, then, this book?&rdquo; said the party, in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see,&rdquo; said Paul, solemnly; &ldquo;for though I have never shown it
      since, nor have I ever told the story before, here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he drew from his bosom a small square volume, bound in
      vellum, and fastened by a clasp; lettered on the cover, &ldquo;Signals of the
      Channel Fleet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the secret of honest Paul's life; and as he turned over the
      leaves, he expatiated with eloquent delight on the various British emblems
      which were represented there, in all their brilliant coloring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That double streak of yellow on the black is to make all sail, Comrades,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Whenever they see us standing out to sea you may remark that
      signal flying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is this large blue flag here, with all the colored bars across
      it?&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;they're very fond of that ensign; what can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close action,&rdquo; growled out Paul, sullenly, who didn't fancy even the
      reflective praise this question implied to the hated rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sacrebleu!</i>&rdquo; said a third, &ldquo;they've no other to announce a victory.
      Look here; it is the same flag for both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul shut up the book at this, with a muttered curse, which might have
      been intended either for his comrades or the English, or both together,
      and the whole party became suddenly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now that the landlord's tact became conspicuous; for instead of any
      condoling expressions on what might have been deemed the unsuccessful
      result of Paul's career, he affected to think that the brave seaman was
      more to be envied for the possession of that volume than if he walked the
      deck an admiral of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      This flattery, aided by a fresh supply of Burgundy, had full success; and
      from story-telling the party fell to singing,&mdash;the songs being only a
      more boastful detail of their prowess at sea than their prose narratives;
      and even here Paul maintained his supremacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep, however, stronger than self-glorification and pride, fell on the
      party one by one, and they lay down at last on the tables and benches, and
      slumbered heavily.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. A MOONLIGHT RECOGNITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      I sat on my bed in the little chamber allotted me, and as the bright
      moonlight streamed along the floor, and lit up the wide landscape without,
      I hesitated within myself whether I should await the morning, or at once
      set forth on my way to the coast. It was true the abbé had not arrived;
      and without him I knew nothing of the vessel, nor where she lay, much less
      by what means I should induce the crew to receive me as a passenger. But
      my heart was fixed on gaining the coast; once there, I felt that the sea
      alone rolled between me and my country, and I had little doubt some means
      of escape would present itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desire to return to Ireland, long stilled, was now become a passion. I
      thought some new career must there open for me, and in its active
      vicissitudes I should make amends for the wearisome languor of my late
      life. What this novel path was to be, and where to lead, I cannot say; nor
      am I able now, in looking back, to guess by what sophistry I persuaded
      myself into this belief. It was the last ray of hope within me, however,
      and I cherished it only the more fondly for its very uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sat thus deliberating with myself what course to take, the door was
      cautiously opened, and the landlord entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is come,&rdquo; whispered he; &ldquo;and, thank Heaven! not too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The abbé?&rdquo; inquired I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not the abbé; but the Comte de Chambord. The abbé will not venture;
      but it matters not, if you will. The letters are all ready; the sloop is
      off the coast; the wind is fair&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not a moment to be lost,&rdquo; added a deep, low voice, as the figure of a
      tall man, wrapped in a travelling cloak, darkened the doorway. &ldquo;Leave us,
      Pierre; this is the gentleman, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;Should you need a light, I 'll bring one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, friend; we can dispense with any, save what the moon affords
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed on the retiring figure of the host, the stranger took
      his place beside me on the bed, and in a low voice thus began:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know, sir, that you have the full confidence of one of my
      stanchest and best friends, who tells me that you are willing to incur
      great risk, provided you gain the chance of reaching your native land.
      That chance&mdash;nay, I will call it that certainty&mdash;lies in my
      power; and, in return for the assistance, are you willing to do me a
      service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I served the Emperor, sir; ask me not anything unworthy of one who wore
      his epaulette. Aught else, if it be but honorable and fair, I 'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no leisure for casuistry, nor is it my humor, sir,&rdquo; replied he
      angrily. &ldquo;Neither do I seek any wondrous devotion at your hands. The
      service is an easy one: costs nothing at the present; involves nothing for
      the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The slight value you place upon it may detract but little from my
      objection,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sacré ciel!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed he, in a louder voice, as he sprang from
      the bed and clasped his hands before him. &ldquo;Is it to be ever thus? Is every
      step we take to be marred by some unlooked for casualty? Is the stamp of
      fear and vacillation to be on every act of our lives? This abbé, the
      creature we have made, the man whose fortune is our handiwork, could
      render but one service to our cause; and he fails us in our need. And now,
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware, sir, how you speak to one who has never been accustomed to hear
      his name slightingly used nor his honor impugned. With your cause,
      whatever it be, I have no sympathy. Remember that; and remember, also, we
      are strangers to each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>par Saint Denis!</i> that we are not!&rdquo; said he, seizing me by the
      arm, as he turned his head round, and stared me steadfastly in the face.
      &ldquo;It was but this instant I deemed my fortune at the worst; and now I find
      myself mistaken. Do you know me now?&rdquo; said he, throwing off his travelling
      cap, and letting his cloak fall from his shoulders to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Beauvais!&rdquo; exclaimed I, thunderstruck at the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; the same De Beauvais whose fortunes you have blighted, whose
      honor you have tarnished&mdash;Interrupt me not. The mill at Hôlbrun
      witnessed the latter, if even the former were an error; and now we meet
      once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as enemies, however; at least on my side. You may persist, if you
      will, in attributing to me wrongs I never inflicted. I can better bear the
      imputation, unjust though it be, than involve myself in any quarrel with
      one I feel no anger towards. I was in hopes a few hours hence might have
      seen me on my way from France forever; but here, or elsewhere, I will not
      reply to your enmity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Beauvais made no reply as I concluded, but with his arms crossed, and
      head bent down, seemed lost in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said he, at length, in a slow, sad voice, &ldquo;you have not found
      the service of the Usurper as full of promise as you hoped; you have
      followed his banner long enough to learn how mean a thing even ambition
      may be, and how miserably selfish is the highest aspiration of an
      adventurer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Emperor was my good master,&rdquo; said I, sternly; &ldquo;it would ill become me
      to vent my disappointment on aught save my own demerits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen as slight deservings bring a high reward, notwithstanding,&rdquo;
       replied he; &ldquo;ay, and win their meed of praise from lips whose eulogy was
      honor. There was a service, Burke&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, no more of this!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You are unjust to your own cause and to
      me, if you deem that the hour of baffled hopes is that in which I could
      see its justice. <i>You</i> are true and faithful to one whose fortunes
      look darkly. I respect the fidelity, while I will not follow its dictates.
      I leave the path where fame and riches abound; I only ask you to believe
      that I do so with honor. Let us part, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you mean to go, hence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not; a prospect of escape had led me hither. I must now bethink me
      of some other course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burke, I am your debtor for one kindness, at least,&rdquo; said De Beauvais,
      after a brief pause. &ldquo;You saved my life at the risk of your own. The night
      at the Château d'Ancre should never be forgotten by me; nor had it been,
      if I did not revenge my own disappointed hopes, in not seducing you to our
      cause, upon yourself. It may be that I wrong you in everything as in
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, that you do, De Beauvais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it as it may, I am your debtor. I came here to-night to meet one who
      had pledged himself to perform a service. He has failed in his promise;
      will you take his place? The same means of escape shall be yours. All the
      precautions for his safety and sure conduct shall be taken in your behalf.
      I ask no pledge for the honorable discharge of what I seek at your hands,
      save your mere assent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you require of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you deliver these letters to their several addresses; that you do so
      with your own hands; that when questioned, as you may be, on the state of
      France, you will not answer as the partisan of the Usurper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you. Enough: I refuse your offer. Your zeal for the cause
      you serve must indeed be great when it blinds you to all consideration for
      one placed as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has made me forget more, sir, far more than that, as I might prove to
      you, were I to tell what my life has been for two years past. But for such
      forgetfulness there is an ample recompense, a glorious one,&mdash;the
      memory of our king.&rdquo; He paused at these words, and in his tremulous voice
      and excited gesture I could read the passion that worked within him.
      &ldquo;Come, then; there shall be no more question of a compact between us. I
      ask no conditions, I seek for no benefits: you shall escape. Take my
      horse; my servant, who is also mounted, will accompany you to Beudron,
      where you will find fresh horses in readiness. This passport will prevent
      all interruption or delay; it is countersigned by Fouché himself. At
      Lisieux, which you will reach by sunset, you can leave the cattle, and the
      boy of the cabaret will be your guide to the Falaise de Biville. The tide
      will ebb at eleven o'clock, and a rocket from the sloop will be your
      signal to embark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for this I can render nothing in return?&rdquo; said I, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It may be that in your own country you will hear the followers of
      our king scoffed at and derided,&mdash;called fools or fanatics, perhaps
      worse. I would only ask of you to bear witness that they are at least
      ardent in the cause they have sworn to uphold, and firm to the faith to
      which they have pledged themselves. This is the only service you can
      render us, but it is no mean one. And now, farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, De Beauvais! But ere we separate forever, let me hear from your
      lips that you bear me no enmity; that we are friends, as we used to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is my hand. I care not if you injured me once; we can be friends
      now, for we are little likely to meet again as enemies. Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While De Beauvais left the room to order the horses to be in readiness,
      the landlord entered it, and seemed to busy himself most eagerly in
      preparing my knapsack for the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you will be many a mile hence ere the day breaks,&rdquo; said he, with
      an anxiety I could ill comprehend, but which at the time I attributed to
      his desire for the safety of one intrusted with an important mission. &ldquo;And
      now, here come the horses.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment more, and I was seated in the saddle. A brief word at parting was
      all De Beauvais spoke, and turned away; and the minute after I was
      hurrying onward towards Beudron.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. THE FALAISE DE BIVILLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Everything occurred as De Beauvais had predicted. The authorities in the
      little villages we passed glanced at my passport, and as instantaneously
      handed it back, and we journeyed like couriers of the Emperor, without
      halt or impediment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached Lisieux early in the evening, where, having dismissed the
      servant and horses, I took my way on foot towards a small fishing village,
      called La Hupe, where at a certain cabaret I was to find my guide to
      Biville.
    </p>
    <p>
      The address of the sailor written on a card, and marked with a peculiar
      cipher by De Beauvais, was at once recognized by the old Norman, who
      welcomed me with a rude but kindly hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art more like a man to make this venture than the last three who
      came down here,&rdquo; said he, as he slowly measured me with his eye from head
      to foot. &ldquo;These priests they sent us never dared even to look at the
      coast, much less to descend the cliffs; but thou hast a look about thee of
      another fashion. And now, the first thing is to have something to eat, and
      I promise thee a <i>goutte</i> of brandy will not be amiss to prepare thee
      for what is before thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there, then, so much of danger in the descent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if a man's head be steady and his hand firm; but he must have both,
      and a stout heart to guide them, or the journey is not over-pleasant. Art
      thou cool enough in time of peril to remember what has been told thee for
      thy guidance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I hope I can promise so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then thou art all safe; so eat away, and leave the rest to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although the sailor's words had stimulated my curiosity in the highest
      degree, I repressed every semblance of the feeling, and ate my supper with
      a well-feigned appearance of easy indifference; while he questioned me
      about the hopes of the Bourbon party in their secret machinations, with a
      searching inquisitiveness that often nearly baffled all my ingenuity in
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! <i>par Saint Denis!</i>&rdquo; said he, with a deep sigh, &ldquo;I see well thou
      hast small hope now; and, in truth, I feel as thou dost. When George
      Cadoudal and his brave fellows failed, where are we to look for success? I
      mind well the night he supped here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, said you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, where you sit now,&mdash;on the same seat. There was an English
      officer with him. He wore a blue uniform, and sat yonder, beneath that
      fishing-net; the others were hid along the shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it here they landed, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure, at the Falaise; there is not another spot to land on for
      miles along the coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old sailor then began a circumstantial account of the arrival of
      George and his accomplices from England; and told how they had one by one
      scaled the cliffs by means of a cord, well known in these parts, called
      the &ldquo;smuggler's rope.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou shalt see the spot now,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;for
      there's the signal yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed as he spoke to an old ruined tower, which crowned a cliff about
      half a mile distant, and from a loophole in which I could see a branch of
      ivy waving, as though moved by the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what may that mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cutter is in sight; as the wind is off shore, she 'll be able to come
      in close to-night. Indeed, if it blew from the westward, she dared not
      venture nearer, nor thou, either, go down to meet her. So, now let's be
      moving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About twenty minutes' walking brought us to the old signal-tower, on
      looking from the window of which I beheld the sea plashing full three
      hundred feet beneath. The dark rocks, fissured by time and weather, were
      abrupt as a wall, and in some places even overhung the waves that rolled
      heavily below. Masses of tangled seaweed and shells, which lay in the
      crevices of the cliffs, showed where in times of storm the wild waters
      were thrown; while lower down, amid fragments of rocks, the heavy beams
      and planks of shipwrecked vessels surged with every motion of the tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot see the cutter now,&rdquo; said the old sailor,&mdash;&ldquo;the setting
      sun leaves a haze over the sea; but in a few minutes more we shall see
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am rather looking for the pathway down this bold cliff,&rdquo; replied I, as
      I strained my eyes to catch something like a way to descend by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then throw thine eyes in this direction,&rdquo; said the sailor, as he pointed
      straight down beneath the window of the tower. &ldquo;Seest thou that chain
      there? Well, follow it a little farther, and thou may'st mark a piece of
      timber jutting from the rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see it plainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the path thou asketh for is beneath that spar. It is a good rope of
      stout hemp, and has carried the weight of many a brave fellow before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The smuggler's rope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same. Art afraid to venture, now thou seest the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll not find me so, friend. I have seen danger as close before now,
      and did not blink it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark me well, then,&rdquo; said he, laying his hand on my arm. &ldquo;When thou
      readiest that rope, thou wilt let thyself cautiously down to a small
      projecting point of rock; we cannot see it here, but thou wilt soon
      discern it in the descent. The rope from this goes no farther, for that
      spot is nigh sixty fathom below us. From thence the cliff slopes sharply
      down about thirty or forty feet. Here thou must creep cautiously,&mdash;for
      the moss is dry and slippery at this season,&mdash;till thou nearest the
      edge. Mark me well, now: near the edge thou'lt find a large stone
      fast-rooted in the ground; and around that another rope is fastened, by
      which thou may'st reach the bottom of the precipice. There is but one
      place of peril in the whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sloping bank, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that bit will try thy nerve. Remember, if thy foot slip, there's
      nothing to stop thy fall; the cliff is rounded over the edge, and the blue
      sea beats two hundred feet below it. And see! look yonder, far away there!
      Seest thou the twinkling, as of a small star, on the water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cutter will throw up a rocket, will she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rocket!&rdquo; repeated he, contemptuously; &ldquo;that's some landsman's story
      thou hast been listening to. A rocket would bring the whole fleet of boats
      from Tréport on her. No, no; they know better than that: the faintest
      glimmer of a fishing-craft is all they 'll dare to show. But see how
      steadily it burns now! we must make the signal seawards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo, Joseph! a light there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A boy's voice answered from the upper part of the tower,&mdash;the same
      figure who made the signal towards the shore, and whose presence there I
      had altogether forgotten; and in a few minutes a red glare on the rocks
      below showed that the old man's command was obeyed, and the beacon
      lighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! they see it already,&rdquo; cried he, triumphantly, pointing seawards;
      &ldquo;they've extinguished the light now, but will show it again, from time to
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, friend, how happens it that the marines of the Guard, who
      line this coast, do not perceive these signals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who tells thee that they do not? They may be looking, as we are now,
      at that same craft, and watching Her as she beats in shore; but they know
      better than to betray us. Ah, <i>ma foi!</i> the 'contrebande' is better
      than the Government. Enough for them if they catch some poor English
      prisoner now and then, and have him shot; that contents the Emperor, as
      they call him, and he thinks the service all that is brave and vigilant.
      But as to us, it is our own fault if we fall in with them; it would need
      the rocket you spoke of a while ago to shame them into it. There, look
      again,&mdash;thou seest how far in shore they've made already; the cutter
      is stealing fast along the water. Answer the signal, Joseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy replenished the fire with some dry wood, and it blazed up
      brilliantly, illuminating the gray cliffs and dark rocks, on which the
      night was fast falling, but leaving all beyond its immediate sphere in
      deepest blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see not, friend, by what means I am to discover this sloping cliff,
      much less guide my way along it,&rdquo; said I, as I gazed over the precipice,
      and tried to penetrate the gloomy abyss below me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou 'lt have the moon at full in less than two hours; and if thou 'lt
      take a friend's counsel, thou 'lt have a sleep ere that time. Lay thee
      down yonder on those rushes; I 'll awake thee when time comes for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rather that I resolved to obey my old guide in his every direction,
      than from any desire for slumber at such a time, I followed his advice,
      and threw myself full length in a corner of the tower. In the perfect
      stillness of the hour, the sea alone was heard, surging in slow, minute
      peals through many a deep cavern below; and then, gathering for fresh
      efforts, it swelled and beat against the stern rocks in passionate fury.
      Such sounds, heard in the silence of the night, are of the saddest; nor
      was their influence lightened by the low, monotonous chant of the old
      sailor, who, seated in a corner, began to repair a fishing-net, as he sang
      to himself some ditty of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      How strangely came the thought to my mind, that all the peril I once
      incurred to reach France, the hoped-for, wished-for land, I should again
      brave to escape from its shores! Every dream of boyish ambition
      dissipated, every high hope flown, I was returning to my country as poor
      and humble as I left it, but with a heart shorn of all the enthusiasm that
      gave life its coloring. In what way I could shape my future career I was
      not able even to guess; a vague leaning to some of England's distant
      colonies, some new world beyond the seas, being all my imagination could
      frame of my destiny. A sudden flash of light, illuminating the whole
      interior of the tower, startled me from my musings, while the sailor
      called out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, wake up, friend! The cutter is standing in close, and a signal to
      make haste flying from her mast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sprang to my legs, and looked out. The sea was all freckled with the
      moonlight, and the little craft shone like silver, as the bright beams
      glanced on her white sails. The tall cliffs alone preserved their gloom,
      and threw a dark and frowning shadow over the waves beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see nothing close to shore,&rdquo; said I, pointing to the dark rocks
      beneath the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou'lt have the moon presently; she's rising above the crest of the
      hill, and then the cliffs are clear as at noonday. So, make haste! strap
      on that knapsack on your shoulder; high up, mind; and give thine arms full
      play,&mdash;that's it. Now fasten thy shoes over all; thou wert not about
      to wear them, surely?&rdquo; said he in a tone almost derisive. &ldquo;Take care, in
      keeping from the face of the rock, not to sway the rope; it wears the
      cordage. And, above all, mind well when thou reachest the cliff below; let
      not thy hold go before thou hast well felt thy footing. See, the moon is
      up already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, a vast sheet of yellow light seemed to creep over the whole
      face of the precipice, displaying every crag and projection, and making
      every spot of verdure or rock brilliant in color; while, many a fathom
      down below, the heavy waves were seen,&mdash;now rising in all their
      majestic swell, now pouring back in their thousand cataracts from every
      fissure in the precipice. So terribly distinct did each object show, so
      dreadfully was each distance marked, I felt that all its former gloom and
      darkness were not one half so thrilling as that moonlight splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La bonne Marie guard thee now!&rdquo; said the old seaman, as he wrung my hand
      in his strong fingers. &ldquo;Be steady and cool of head, and there is no
      danger; and look not downwards till thou hast got accustomed to the
      cliff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, he opened a small door at the foot of the tower stair,
      and passing through himself, desired me to follow. I did so, and now found
      myself on a narrow ledge of rock, directly over the crag; below, at about
      ten feet, lay the chain to which the rope was attached, and to reach it
      was not the least perilous part of the undertaking. But in this I was
      assisted by the old man, who, passing a rope through a massive iron
      staple, gradually lowered me till my hand came opposite the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast it now,&rdquo; cried he, as he saw me disengage one hand and grasp
      the iron links firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all safe! Good-by, friend; good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait yet,&rdquo; cried he again. &ldquo;Let not go the cord before thou thinkest a
      minute or so; I have known more than one change his mind when he felt
      himself where thou art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine is made up. Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, stay!&rdquo; shouted he rapidly. &ldquo;See, thou hast forgotten this purse on
      the rock here; wait, and I will lower it with a cord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time I had grasped the chain firmly with both hands, and with the
      resolve of one who felt life depend on his own firmness, I began the
      descent. The old man's voice, as he muttered a prayer for my safety, grew
      fainter and fainter, till at length it ceased to reach my ears altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the first time, did my heart sink within me. The words of one
      human being, faint and broken by distance, suggested a sense of sympathy
      which nerved my courage and braced my arm; but the dreary silence that
      followed, only broken by the booming of the sea below, was awful beyond
      measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hand below hand I went, the space seeming never to lessen, as I strained
      my eyes to catch the cliff where the first rope ended. Time, as in some
      fearful dream, seemed protracted to years long; and I already anticipated
      the moment when, my strength failing, my hands would relinquish their
      hold, and I should be dashed upon the dark rocks below. The very
      sea-birds, which I startled in my descent, wheeled round my head, piercing
      the air with their shrill cries, and as if impatient for a prey. Above my
      head the frowning cliff beetled darkly; below, a depth unfathomable seemed
      to stretch, from whose black abyss arose the wild sounds of beating waves.
      More than once, too, I thought that the rope had given way above, and that
      I was actually falling through the air,&mdash;and held my breath in
      horror; then, again, the idea flashed upon me that death inevitable
      awaited me, and I fancied in the singing billows I could hear the wild
      shouts of demons rejoicing over my doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all these maddening visions, the instinct to preserve my life held
      its strong sway, and I clutched the knotted rope with the eager grasp of a
      drowning man; when suddenly I felt my foot strike a rock beneath, and then
      discovered I was on the cliff of which the sailor had told me. In a few
      seconds the sense of security imparted a thrill of pleasure to my heart,
      and I uttered a prayer of thankfulness for my safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fearful conviction of greater danger as suddenly succeeded. The
      rope I had so long trusted terminated here; the end hung listlessly on the
      rock, and from thence to the brow of the cliff nothing remained to afford
      a grip save the short moss and the dried ferns withered with the sun. The
      surface of this frightful ledge sloped rapidly towards the edge where was
      the rock around which the rope was tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatigued by my previous exertion I sat down on that moss-grown cliff and
      gazed out upon the sea, along which the cutter came, proudly dashing the
      spray from her bows, and bending gracefully with every wave. She was
      standing fearlessly in, for the wind was off the land, and, as she swept
      along, I could have fancied her directly beneath my very feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arousing myself from the momentary stupor of my faculties, I began to
      creep down the cliff; but so slippery had the verdure become by heat, that
      I could barely sustain myself by grasping the very earth with my fingers.
      Aloud &ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; was shouted from the craft, and arose in many an echo
      around me; I tried to reply, but could not. A second cheer saluted me, but
      I did not endeavor to answer it. The moment was full of peril. I had come
      to the last spot which offered a hold, and below me, at some feet, lay the
      rock, hanging, as it were, over the precipice; it seemed to me as though a
      sea-bird's weight might have sent it thundering into the depth beneath.
      The moon was on it, and I could see the rope coiled twice around it, and
      knotted carefully. What would I have given in that terrible minute for one
      tuft of grass, one slender bough, even enough to have sustained my weight
      for a second or two, until I should grasp the cord! But none was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A louder cry from the cutter now rang in my ears, and the dreadful thought
      of destruction now flashed on me. I fixed my eyes on the rock to measure
      the place; and then, turning with my face towards the cliff, I suffered
      myself to slip downwards. At first I went slowly; then faster and faster.
      At last my legs passed over the brow of the precipice. I was falling! My
      head reeled. I uttered a cry, and in an agony of despair threw out my
      hands. They caught the rope. Knot after knot slipped past my fingers in
      the descent ere my senses became sufficiently clear to know what was
      occurring. But even then the instinct of self-preservation was stronger
      than reason; for I afterwards learned from the boat's crew with what skill
      I guided myself along the face of the cliff, avoiding every difficulty of
      the jagged rocks, and tracking my way like the most experienced climber.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood upon a broad fiat rock, over which white sheets of foam were
      dashing. Oh, how I loved to see them curling on my feet t I could have
      kissed the bright water on which the moonbeams sported, for the moment of
      danger was passed; the shadow of a dreadful death had moved from my soul.
      What cared I now for the boiling surf that toiled and fretted about me?
      The dangers of the deep were as nothing to that I escaped from; and when
      the cutter's boat came bounding towards me, I minded not the oft-repeated
      warnings of the sailors, but plunging in, I dashed towards her on a
      retreating wave, and was dragged on board almost lifeless from my
      struggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red glare of the signal-fire was blazing from the old tower as we got
      under weigh. I felt my eyes riveted on it as I lay on the deck of the
      little vessel, which now stood out to sea in gallant style. It was my last
      look of France, and so I felt it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. THE LANDING
    </h2>
    <p>
      With the crew of the cutter I had little intercourse. They were Jerseymen,&mdash;that
      hybrid race, neither French nor English,&mdash;who followed the trade of
      spies and smugglers, and were true to nothing save their own interests.
      The skipper, a coarse, ill-featured fellow, in no respect superior to the
      others, leisurely perused the letter De Beauvais gave me on my departure;
      then, tearing it slowly, threw the pieces into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, is this?&rdquo; said he, taking up a sealed packet, which I now for
      the first time perceived was fastened to my knapsack. &ldquo;It seems meant for
      me; look at the address, 'Jacques Oloquette, on board the &ldquo;Rouge
      Galant."'&rdquo; And so saying, he broke the seal, and bent over the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried he, in a voice of triumphant delight, &ldquo;this is a prize worth
      having,&mdash;the English signal-book!&rdquo; And he held up the little volume
      which Paul Dupont had rescued from the &ldquo;Fawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came it here?&rdquo; said I, horror-struck at the loss the poor sailor had
      sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Martin, of the 'Star,' tells me he stole it from a marine of the
      Guard, and that it cost him twenty-four flasks of his best Pomard before
      the fellow and his companions were drunk enough to make the theft
      practicable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remembered at once the eagerness of the landlord for my departure, and
      the hurried anxiety of his wish that morning might find me miles off on my
      journey, as well as the care he bestowed on strapping my knapsack, and saw
      how all had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew most of them already,&rdquo; continued the skipper. &ldquo;But here is one
      will serve our turn well now,&mdash;the very thing we wanted, for it saves
      all delay and stoppage. That flag is the signal for Admiralty despatches,
      which are often brought by small craft like ours when they can't spare
      cruisers. We 'll soon rig it out, you 'll see, and run down Channel with
      all our canvas set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went aft as he spoke; and in a few seconds the cutter's head was
      directed straight towards the English coast, while, crowding on more sail,
      she seemed to fly through the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheering freshness of the sea-breeze, the sense of danger past, the
      hope of escape, all combining, raised my spirits and elevated my courage;
      but through all, I felt grieved beyond measure at the loss of poor Paul
      Dupont,&mdash;the prize the honest fellow valued next to life itself, if
      not above it, taken from him in the very moment of his exultation!
      Besides, I could not help feeling that suspicion must light on me from my
      sudden disappearance; and my indignation was deep, to think how such an
      imputation would tarnish the honor of that service I gloried in so much.
      &ldquo;How far may such a calumny spread?&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;How many lips may repeat
      the tale, and none be able to deny it?&rdquo; Deep as was my regret at the brave
      Breton's loss, my anger for its consequences was still deeper; and I would
      willingly have perilled all my hope of reaching England to have been able
      to restore the book into Paul's own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      These feelings did not tend to draw me closer in intimacy with the
      skipper; whose pleasure at the acquisition was only heightened by the
      subtlety of its accomplishment, and who seemed never so happy as when
      repeating some fragment of the landlord's letter, and rejoicing at the
      discomfiture the brave sailor must have experienced on discovering his
      loss. To witness the gratification a coarse nature feels in some unworthy
      but successful action, is the heaviest penalty an honorable mind can
      experience when unhappily its possessor has been in any way accessory to
      the result. With these reflections I fell off to sleep, and never woke
      till the bright sun was shining over the white-crested water, and the
      craft breasting the waves with a strong breeze upon her canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we held on down Channel, we passed several ships of war beating up for
      Spithead; but our blue bunting, curiously streaked with white, was a
      signal which all acknowledged, and none ventured to retard. Thus passed
      the first day: as night was falling, we beheld the Needles on our lee, and
      with a freshening breeze, held on our course.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second morning broke. And now the sea was covered with the white sails
      of a magnificent fleet, bound for the West Indies; at least, so the
      skipper pronounced it. It was indeed a glorious sight to see the mighty
      vessels obeying the signals of the flag-ship, and shaping their course
      through the blue water as if instinct with life and reason. They were far
      seaward of us, however; for now we hugged the land, as the skipper was
      only desirous of an opportunity to land me unobserved before he proceeded
      on his own more immediate enterprise,&mdash;the smuggling of some
      hogsheads of brandy on the coasts of Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to my own thoughts,&mdash;the memories of my past life,&mdash;I
      dreamed away the hours unconsciously, and as the time sped on, I knew not
      of its flight. Some strange sail, seen from afar off, would for an instant
      arouse my attention; but it was a mere momentary effect, and I fell back
      into my musings, as though they had never been interrupted. As I look back
      upon that voyage now, and think of the dreamy listlessness in which its
      hours were passed, I can half fancy that certain periods of our lives are
      destined to sustain the part which night performs in our daily existence,
      and by their monotony contribute to that renewal of energy and vigor so
      essential after times of labor and exertion. It seemed to me as though,
      the period of exertion past, I was regaining in rest and repose the power
      for future action; and I canvassed every act of the past to teach me more
      of my own heart, and to instruct me for my guidance in life after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can land now, whenever you please,&rdquo; said the skipper to me, as by a
      faint moonlight we moved along the waveless sea. &ldquo;We can put you ashore at
      any moment here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started with as much surprise as though the thought had never occurred
      to me; and without replying, I leaned over the bulwark, and gazed at the
      faint shadows of tall headlands about three miles distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you call that bluff yonder?&rdquo; said I, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wicklow Head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wicklow Head! Ireland!&rdquo; cried I, with a thrill of ecstasy my heart had
      never felt for many a day before. &ldquo;Yes, yes; land me there,&mdash;now, at
      once!&rdquo; said I, as a thousand thoughts came rushing to my mind, and hopes
      too vague for utterance, but palpable enough to cherish.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the speed their calling teaches, the crew lowered the boat, and as I
      took my place in the stern, pulled vigorously towards the shore. As the
      swift bark glided along the shallow sea, I could scarce restrain my
      impatience from springing out and rushing on land. Without family or
      friend, without one to welcome or meet me, still it was home,&mdash;the
      only home I ever had.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sharp keel grated on the beach; its sound vibrated within my heart. I
      jumped on shore; a few words of parting, and the men backed their oars;
      the boat slipped fast through the water. The cutter, too, got speedily
      under weigh again, and I was alone. Then the full torrent of my feelings
      found their channel, and I burst into tears. Oh! they were not tears of
      sorrow; neither were they the outpourings of excessive joy. They were the
      utterance of a heart loaded with its own unrelieved griefs, who now found
      sympathy on touching the very soil of home. I felt I was no longer
      friendless. Ireland, my own dear native country, would be to me a place of
      kindred and family, and I fell upon my knees, and blessed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following a little path, which led slantingly up the cliff, I reached the
      top as day was beginning to break, and gained a view of the country. The
      range of swelling hills, dotted with cottages and waving with wood; the
      fields of that emerald green one sees not in other lands; the hedge-rows
      bounding the little farms,&mdash;all so unlike the spreading plains of
      France,&mdash;struck me with delight, and it was with a rapture of
      happiness I called the land my country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directing my steps towards Dublin, I set out at a good pace, but following
      a path which led near the cliffs, in preference to the highroad; for I was
      well aware that my appearance and dress would expose me to curiosity, and
      perhaps subject me to more serious annoyance. My first object was to learn
      some news of my brother; for although the ties of affection had been long
      since severed between us, those of blood still remained, and I wished to
      hear of, and it might be to see him, once more. For some miles I had kept
      my eyes directed towards a little cabin which crowned a cliff that hung
      over the sea; and this I reached at last, somewhat wearied and hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I followed a little footpath which conducted to the door, a fierce
      terrier rushed out as if to attack me, but was immediately restrained by
      the voice of a man within, calling, &ldquo;Down, Vicksey! down, you baste!&rdquo; and
      the same moment a stout, middle-aged man appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be afeard, sir; she's not wicked, but we're unused to strangers
      down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so, friend, from my path,&rdquo; said I, throwing a glance at
      the narrow footway I had followed for some miles, over hill and precipice;
      &ldquo;but I am unacquainted with the country, and was looking out for some
      house where I might obtain a breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a town about three miles down yonder, and a fine inn, I 'm tould,
      sir,&rdquo; replied he, as he scrutinized my appearance with a shrewd eye; &ldquo;but
      if I might make so bould, maybe you 'd as lief not go there, and perhaps
      you 'd take share of what we have here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said I, accepting the hospitable offer as freely as it was
      made, and entered the cabin at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good-featured countrywoman and some young children were seated at the
      table, where a large dish of potatoes and some fresh fish were smoking, a
      huge jug of milk occupying the middle of the board. The woman blushed as
      she heard that her husband had invited a gentleman to partake of his
      humble meal; but the honest fellow cared little for the simple fare he
      offered with so good a grace, and placed my chair beside his own with the
      air of one who was more anxious for his guest's comfort than caring what
      impression he himself might make upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some passing words about the season and the state of the tides,&mdash;for
      my host was a fisherman,&mdash;I turned the conversation on the political
      condition of the country, avowing frankly that I had been for some years
      absent, and was ignorant of what had occurred meantime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas that same I was thinking, sir,&rdquo; said he, replying to the first and
      not the latter part of my remark. &ldquo;When I saw your honor's face, and the
      beard you wore, I said to myself you wor a Frenchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistook there, then; I am your countryman, but have passed a good
      many years in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fighting for Boney?&rdquo; said he, as his eyes opened wide with surprise to
      behold one actually before him who might have served under Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my good friend, even so; I was in the army of the Emperor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tare an ages! then, are they coming over here now?&rdquo; cried he, almost
      gasping in his eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied I, gravely; &ldquo;and be thankful, too, for it, for your own
      and your children's sakes, that you see not a war raging in the fields and
      cities of your native land. Be assured, whatever wrongs you suffer,&mdash;I
      will not dispute their existence, for, as I told you, I am ignorant of the
      condition of the country,&mdash;but whatever they may be, you can pay too
      dearly for their remedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sure they 'd be on our side, would n't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they would; but think you that they 'd fight your battles
      without their price? Do you believe that Frenchmen so love you here that
      they would come to shed their blood in your cause without their own
      prospect of advantage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They hate the English, I'm tould, as bad as we do ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do so, and with more of justice for their hate. But that dislike
      might suffice to cause a war; it never would reward it. No, no; I know
      something of the spirit of French conquest. I glory in the bravery and the
      heroism that accomplished it; but I never wish to see my own country at
      the mercy of France. Whose soldier would you become if the Emperor
      Napoleon landed here to-morrow?&mdash;his. Whose uniform would you wear,
      whose musket carry, whose pay receive, whose orders obey?&mdash;his, and
      his only. And how long, think you, would your services be limited to home?
      What should prevent your being sent away to Egypt, to Poland, or to
      Russia? How much favor would an Irish deserter receive from a French
      court-martial, think you? No, good friend; while you have this warm roof
      to shelter you, and that broad sea is open for your industry and toil,
      never wish for foreign aid to assist you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that the poor fellow was discouraged by my words, and gradually led
      him to speak of those evils for whose alleviation he looked to France. To
      my surprise, however, he descanted less on political grievances than those
      which affect the well-being of the country socially. It was not the
      severity of a Government, but the absence of encouragement to industry,&mdash;the
      neglect of the poor,&mdash;which afflicted him. England was no longer the
      tyrant; the landlord had taken her place. Still, with the pertinacity of
      ignorance, he visited all the wrongs on that land from which originally
      his first misfortunes came, and with perverse ingenuity would endeavor to
      trace out every hardship he suffered as arising from the ill-will and
      hatred the Saxon bore him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to perceive that the arguments he used were not of his own
      devising; they had been supplied by others, in whose opinion he had
      confidence; and though valueless and weak in reality, to him they were
      all-convincing and unanswerable,&mdash;not the less, perhaps, that they
      offered that value to self-love which comes from attributing any evils we
      endure to causes outside and independent of ourselves. These, confronted
      with extravagant hopes of what would ensue should national independence be
      established, formed his code; and however refuted on each point, a certain
      conviction, too deeply laid to be disturbed by any opposing force,
      remained; and in his &ldquo;Well, well, God knows best! and maybe we'll have
      better luck yet,&rdquo; you could perceive that he was inaccessible to any
      appeal except from the quarter which ministered to his discontent and
      disaffection.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing was clear to me from all he said, that if the spirit of open
      resistance no longer existed towards England, it was replaced by as
      determined and as rancorous hatred,&mdash;a brooding, ill-omened dislike
      had succeeded, to the full as hostile, and far less easily subdued. How it
      would end,&mdash;whether in the long-lingering fear which wastes the
      energies and saps the strength of a people, or in the conflict of a civil
      war, the prospect was equally ruinous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadly pondering on these things, I parted with my humble host, and set out
      towards the capital. If my conversation with the Irishman had taught me
      somewhat of the state of feeling then current in Ireland, it also conveyed
      another and very different lesson; it enabled me to take some account of
      the change years had effected in my own sentiments. As a boy, high-flown,
      vague, and unsettled ideas of national liberty and independence had made
      me look to France as the emancipator of Europe. As a man, I knew that the
      lust of conquest had extinguished the love of freedom in Frenchmen; that
      they who trusted to her did but exchange the dominion of their old masters
      for the tyranny of a new one; while such as boldly stepped forward in
      defence of their liberties, found that there was neither mercy nor
      compassion for the conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had seen the Austrian prisoners and the Russian led captive through the
      streets of Paris; I had witnessed the great capital of Prussia in its day
      of mourning after Jena; and all my idolatry for the General scarce
      balanced my horror of the Emperor, whose vengeance had smitten two nations
      thus heavily: and I said within my heart, &ldquo;May my countrymen, whatever be
      their day of need, never seek alliance with despotic France!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. A CHARACTER OF OLD DUBLIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was about nine o'clock of a calm summer evening as I entered Dublin,&mdash;nearly
      the same hour at which, some ten years before, I had approached that city,
      poor, houseless, friendless; and still was I the same. In that great
      capital of my country I had not one to welcome me; not one who would
      rejoice at my coming, or feel any interest in my fortunes. This indeed was
      loneliness,&mdash;utter solitude. Still, if there be something which
      weighs heavily on the heart in the isolation of one like me, there is a
      proportionate sense of independence of his fellow-man that sustains the
      courage and gives energy to the will. I felt this as I mixed with the
      crowds that thronged the streets, and shrank not from the inquisitive
      glances which my questionable appearance excited as I passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though considerable changes had taken place in the outskirts of the
      capital since I had seen it last, the leading thoroughfares were just as I
      remembered them; and as I walked along Dame Street, and one by one each
      familiar object caught my eye, I could almost have fancied the long
      interval since I had been there before like a mere dream. National
      physiognomy, too, has a strange effect on him who has been long absent
      from his country. Each face you meet seems well known. The traits of
      features, to which the eye was once so well accustomed, awake a memory of
      individuals, and it is sometimes a moat difficult task to distinguish
      between the acquaintance and the passing stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      This I experienced at every moment; and at length, as I stood gazing on
      the space before the Bank, and calling to mind the last scene I witnessed
      there, a tall, strongly-built man brushed close past me, and then turning
      round, fixed a steady and searching look on me. As I returned his stare, a
      sudden thought flashed upon me that I had seen the face before; but where,
      how, and when, I could not call to mind. And thus we stood silently
      confronting each other for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are a stranger here, sir,&rdquo; said he, touching his hat
      courteously; &ldquo;can I be of service to you with any information as to the
      city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was curious to know, sir,&rdquo; said I, still more puzzled by the voice than
      I had been by the features of the stranger, &ldquo;if Miley's Hotel, which was
      somewhere in the neighborhood, exists still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does, sir; but it has changed proprietors several times since you knew
      it,&rdquo; replied he, significantly. &ldquo;The house is yonder, where you see that
      large lamp. I perceive, sir, I was mistaken in supposing you a foreigner.
      I wish you good-evening.&rdquo; And again saluting me, he resumed his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I crossed the street towards the hotel, I remarked that he turned as if
      to watch me, and became more than ever embarrassed as to who he might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doorway of the hotel was crowded with loungers and idlers of every
      class, from the loitering man about town to the ragged newsvendor, between
      whom, whatever disparity of condition existed, a tone of the most
      free-and-easy condition prevailed; the newsmen interpolating, amid the
      loud announcements of the latest intelligence, the reply to the
      observation beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One figure was conspicuous in the group. He was a short, dwarfish
      creature, with an enormous head, covered with a fell of black hair,
      falling in masses down his back and on his shoulders. A pair of fierce,
      fiery black eyes glared beneath his heavy brows; and a large, thick-lipped
      mouth moved with all the glib eloquence of his class and calling.
      Fearfully distorted legs and club feet gave to his gait a rolling motion,
      which added to the singularity of his whole appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terry Regan was then at the head of his walk in Dublin; and to his
      capacious lungs and voluble tongue were committed the announcement of
      those great events which, from time to time, were given to the Irish
      public through the columns of the &ldquo;Correspondent&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Dublin
      Journal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I soon found myself in the crowd around this celebrated character, who
      was, as usual, extolling the great value of that night's paper by certain
      brief suggestions regarding its contents.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the whole, full, and true account (bad luck to the less!) of the
      great and sanguinary battle between Boney and the Roosians; with all the
      particklars about the killed, wounded, and missing; with what Boney said
      when it was over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that, Terry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould yer peace, ye spalpeen! Is it to the likes of yez I 'd be telling
      cabinet sacrets? (Here, yer honor),&mdash;'Falkner,' is it, or 'The
      Saunders'. With the report of Mr. O'Gogorman's grand speech in Ennis on
      the Catholic claims. There's, yer sowl, there's fippence worth any day ay
      the week. More be token, the letter from Jemmy O'Brien to his wife, wid an
      elegant epic poem called 'The Gauger.' Bloody news, gentlemen! bloody
      news! Won't yez sport a tester for a sight of a real battle, and ten
      thousand kilt; with 'The Whole Duty of an Informer, in two easy lessons.'
      The price of stocks and shares&mdash;Ay, Mr. O'Hara, and what boroughs is
      bringing in the market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last sally was directed towards a large, red-faced man, who
      good-humoredly joined in the laugh against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who's this, boys?&rdquo; cried the fellow, turning suddenly his piercing
      eyes on me, as I endeavored, step by step, to reach the door of the hotel.
      &ldquo;Hurrool look at his beard, acushla! On my conscience, I wouldn't wonder
      if it was General Hoche himself. 'Tis late yer come, sir,&rdquo; said he,
      addressing me directly; &ldquo;there's no fun here now at all, barrin' what
      Beresford has in the riding-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away, you ruffian!&rdquo; said a well-dressed and respectable-looking man,
      somewhat past the middle of life; &ldquo;how dare you permit your tongue to take
      liberties with a stranger? Allow me to make room for you, sir,&rdquo; continued
      he, as he politely made an opening in the crowd, and suffered me to enter
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, counsellor, dear, don't be cross,&rdquo; whined out the newsvendor; &ldquo;sure,
      isn't it wid the bad tongue we both make our bread. And here,&rdquo; vociferated
      he once more,&mdash;&ldquo;and here ye have the grand dinner at the Lord
      Mayor's, wid all the speeches and toasts; wid the glorious, pious, and
      immortial memory of King William, who delivered us from Popery (by pitched
      caps), from slavery (by whipping), from brass money (by bad ha'pence), and
      from wooden shoes (by bare feet). Haven't we reason to bless his&mdash;?
      Ay, the heavens be his bed! 'Tis like Molly Crownahon's husband he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that, Terry?&rdquo; asked a gentleman near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a 'Saunders,' yer honor, and I 'll tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, then, here's fippence; and now for the explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Molly Crownahon, yer honor, was, like us poor craytures, always grateful
      and contented wid the Lord's goodness to us, even in taking away our chief
      comfort and blessing,&mdash;the darling up there on the horse! (Ah, 'tis
      an elegant sate ye have, without stirrups!) And she went one day to say a
      handful of prayers oyer his grave,&mdash;the husband's, ye mind,&mdash;and
      sure if she did, when she knelt down on the grass she sprung up again as
      quick as she went down, for the nettles was all over the place entirely.
      'Bad scran to ye, Peter!' says she, as she rubbed her legs,&mdash;'bad
      scran to ye! living or dead, there was always a sting in ye.'&rdquo;

    <p>
      As the latter part of this speech was addressed in a tone of apostrophe to
      the statue of King William, it was received by the assembled crowd with a
      roar of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time I had entered the house, and only bethought me how little
      suited was the great hotel of the city to pretensions as humble as mine.
      It was now, however, too late to retreat, and I entered the coffee-room,
      carrying my knapsack in my hand. As I passed up the room in search of a
      vacant table, the looks of astonishment my appearance excited on each side
      were most palpable evidences that the company considered me as an
      interloper. While some contented themselves with a stare of steady
      surprise, others, less guarded in their impertinence, whispered with, and
      even winked at their neighbors, to attract attention towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Offensive as this unquestionably was, it amazed even more than it annoyed
      me. In France, such a display of feeling would have been impossible; and
      the humblest soldier of the army would not have been so received had he
      deemed fit to enter Beauvilliers' or Véry's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether hurt at this conduct, and consequently more alive to affront from
      any quarter, or that the waiters participated in the sentiments of their
      betters, I cannot exactly say; but I certainly thought their manner even
      less equivocally betrayed the same desire of impertinence. This was not
      long a mere suspicion on my part; for on inquiring whether I could have a
      room for the night, the waiter, touching my knapsack, which lay on the
      ground beside me, with his foot, replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your luggage, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amazement so completely mastered my indignation at this insolence, that I
      could make no answer but by a look. This had its effect, however; and the
      fellow, without further delay, bustled off to make the inquiry. He
      returned in a few minutes with a civil message, that I could be
      accommodated, and having placed before me the simple meal I ordered,
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sat over my supper, I could not help feeling that unless memory
      played me false, the company were little like the former frequenters of
      this house. I remembered it of old, when Bubbleton and his brother
      officers came there; and when the rooms were thronged with members of both
      Houses of Parliament,&mdash;when peers and gentlemen of the first families
      were grouped about the windows and fireplaces, and the highest names of
      the land were heard in the din of recognition; handsome equipages and led
      horses stood before the doors. But now the ragged mob without was scarce a
      less worthy successor to the brilliant display than were the company
      within to the former visitants. A tone of pretentious impertinence, an air
      of swagger and mock defiance,&mdash;the most opposite to the polished
      urbanity which once prevailed,&mdash;was now conspicuous; and in their
      loud speech and violent gesticulation, it was easy to mark how they had
      degenerated from that high standard which made the Irish gentleman of his
      day the most polished man of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      If in appearance and manner they fell far short of those my memory
      recalled, their conversation more markedly still displayed the long
      interval between them. Here, of old, were retailed the latest news of the
      debate,&mdash;the last brilliant thing of Grattan, or the last biting
      retort of Flood; here came, hot from debate, the great champions of either
      party to relax and recruit for fresh efforts; and in the groups that
      gathered around them you might learn how great genius can diffuse its
      influence and scatter intelligence around it,&mdash;as the Nile waters
      spread plenty and abundance wherever they flow: high and noble sentiments,
      holy aspirations and eloquent thoughts, made an atmosphere, to breathe
      which was to feel an altered nature. But now a vapid mixture of conceit
      and slang had usurped the place of these, and a tone of vulgar
      self-sufficiency unhappily too much in keeping with the externals of those
      who displayed it: the miserable contentions of different factions had
      replaced the bolder strife of opposite parties, and provincialism had put
      its stamp on everything. The nation, too, if I might trust my ears with
      what fell around me, had lost all memory of its once great names, and new
      candidates for popular favor figured in their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were some of the changes I could mark, even as I sat. But my
      attention was speedily drawn from them by a circumstance more nearly
      concerning myself. This was the appearance in the coffee-room of the
      gentleman who first addressed me in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed round the room, followed by a person whose inferiority was
      evident, he was recognized by most of those present, many of whom shook
      him warmly by the hand, and pressed him to join their parties. But this he
      declined, as he continued to walk slowly on, scrutinizing each face as he
      went. At last I saw his eyes turn towards me. It was scarcely a glance, so
      rapid was it, and so quickly were his looks directed to a different
      quarter; but I could mark that he whispered something to a person who
      followed, and then, after carelessly turning over a newspaper on the
      table, sauntered from the room. As he did so, the shaggy head of the dwarf
      newsvendor peeped in, and the great black eyes took a survey of the
      coffee-room, till finally they settled on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the fellow, with a strange blending of irony and compassion in
      his voice; &ldquo;be gorra, I knew how it would be,&mdash;the major has ye!&rdquo; At
      this a general laugh broke out from all present, and every eye was fixed
      on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the follower had taken his place nearly opposite me at the
      table, and was busily engaged examining a paper which he had taken from
      his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask, sir, if your name be Burke?&rdquo; said he, in a low voice, across
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started with amazement to hear my name pronounced where I believed
      myself so completely a stranger, and in my astonishment, forgot to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was asking, sir&mdash;&rdquo; repeated he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are quite correct,&rdquo; interrupted I; &ldquo;that is my name. May I beg
      to know, in return, for what purpose you make the inquiry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas Burke, sir?&rdquo; continued he, inattentive to my observation, and
      apparently about to write the name on the paper before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded, and he wrote down the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That saves a deal of trouble to all of us, sir,&rdquo; said he, as he finished
      writing. &ldquo;This is a warrant for your arrest; but the major is quite
      satisfied if you can give bail for your appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest!&rdquo; repeated I; &ldquo;on what charge am I arrested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll hear in the morning, I suppose,&rdquo; said he, quietly. &ldquo;What shall we
      say about the bail? Have you any acquaintance or friend in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither; I am a perfect stranger here. But if you are authorized to
      arrest me, I here surrender myself at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time, several persons of the coffee-room had approached the table,
      and among the rest the gentleman who so politely made way for me in the
      crowd to reach the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Roche?&rdquo; said he, addressing the man at the table; &ldquo;a
      warrant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; for this gentleman here. But we can take bail, if he has it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you already that I am a stranger, and know no one here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman threw his eyes over the warrant, and then looking me
      steadily in the face, muttered in a whisper to the officer, &ldquo;Why, he must
      have been a boy, a mere child, at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, sir; but the major says it must be done. Maybe you'd bail him
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were added in a tone of half irony, as the fellow gave a sly
      look beneath his eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, again,&rdquo; said I, impatient at the whole scene, &ldquo;I am quite
      ready to accompany you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your name, sir?&rdquo; said the strange gentleman, addressing me, as he
      pointed to the warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interposed the officer, &ldquo;there's no doubt about that; he gave it
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, then, Roche,&rdquo; said he, cajolingly; &ldquo;these are not times for
      undue strictness. Let the gentleman remain where he is to-night, and
      to-morrow he will attend you. You can remain here, if you like, with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say so, I suppose we may do it,&rdquo; replied the officer, as he folded
      up the paper, and arose from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; that's the proper course. And now,&rdquo; said he, addressing me,
      &ldquo;will you permit me to join you while I finish this bottle of claret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could have no objection to so pleasant a proposal; and thus, for the
      time at least, ended this disagreeable affair.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. AN UNFORSEEN EVIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive, sir,&rdquo; said the stranger, seating himself at my table, &ldquo;they
      are desirous to restore an antiquated custom in regard to you. I thought
      the day of indemnities was past and gone forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ignorant to what you allude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The authorities would make you out an emissary of France, sir,&mdash;as
      if France had not enough on her hands already, without embroiling herself
      in a quarrel from which no benefit could accrue; not to speak of the
      little likelihood that any one on such an errand would take up his abode,
      as you have, in the most public hotel of Dublin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no apprehensions as to any charges they may bring against me. I am
      conscious of no crime, saving having left my country a boy, and returning
      to it a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in the service of France, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; since 1801 I have been a soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long? You must have been but a mere boy when you quitted Ireland. How
      have they connected you with the troubles of that period?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated for a second or two, uncertain what answer, if any, I should
      return to this abrupt question. A glance at the manly and frank expression
      of the stranger's face soon satisfied me that no unworthy curiosity had
      prompted the inquiry; and I told him in a few words, how, as a child, the
      opinions of the patriotic party had won me over to embark in a cause I
      could neither fathom nor understand. I traced out rapidly the few leading
      events of my early career down to the last evening I spent in Ireland.
      When I came to this part of my story, the stranger became unusually
      attentive, and more than once questioned me respecting the origin of my
      quarrel with Crofts, and the timely appearance of Darby; of whose name and
      character, however, I gave him no information, merely speaking of him as
      an old and attached follower of my family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since that period, then, you have not been in Ireland?&rdquo; said he, as I
      concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never: nor had I any intention of returning until lately, when
      circumstances induced me to leave the Emperor's service; and from very
      uncertainty I came back here, without well knowing why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, then, you have never heard the catastrophe of your adventure
      with Crofts. It was a lucky hit for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? I don't understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply this: Crofts was discovered in the morning, severely wounded,
      where you left him; his account being, that he had been waylaid by a party
      of rebels, who had obtained the countersign of the night, and passed the
      sentry in various disguises. You yourself&mdash;for so, at least, I
      surmise it must have been&mdash;were designated the prime mover of the
      scheme, and a Government reward was offered for your apprehension. Crofts
      was knighted, and appointed to the staff,&mdash;the reward of his loyalty
      and courage; of the exact details of which my memory is unfortunately
      little tenacious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the truth of the occurrence was never known?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have told you is the only version current. I have reason to
      remember so much of it, for I was then, and am still, one of the legal
      advisers of the Crown, and was consulted on the case; of which, I confess,
      I always had my misgivings. There was a rage, however, for rewarding
      loyalty, as it was termed at the period, and the story went the round of
      the papers. Now, I fancy Crofts would just as soon not see you back again;
      he has made all he can of the adventure, and would as lief have it quietly
      forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can I suffer it to rest here? Is such an imputation to lie on my
      character as he would cast on me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take no steps in the matter on that score: vindication is time enough
      when the attack is made directly; besides, where should you find your
      witness? where is the third party who could prove your innocence, and that
      all you did was in self-defence? Without his testimony, your story would
      go for nothing. No, no; be well satisfied if the charge is suffered to
      sleep, which is not unlikely. Crofts would scarcely like to confess that
      his antagonist was little more than a child; his prowess would gain
      nothing by the avowal. Besides, the world goes well with him latterly; it
      is but a month ago, I think, he succeeded unexpectedly to a large landed
      property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, whose name was M'Dougall, continued to talk for some time
      longer; most kindly volunteered to advise me in the difficult position I
      found myself; and having given me his address in town, wished me a
      goodnight and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to no purpose I laid my head on my pillow. Tired and fatigued as I
      was, I could not sleep; the prospect of fresh troubles awaiting me made me
      restless and feverish, and I longed for day to break, that I might
      manfully confront whatever danger was before me, and oppose a stout heart
      to the arrows of adverse fortune. My accidental meeting with the stranger
      also reassured my courage; and I felt gratified to think that such <i>rencontres</i>
      in life are the sunny spots which illumine our career in the world, the
      harbingers of bright days to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feeling was still more strongly impressed on me as I entered the
      small room on the ground-floor at the Castle, where was the secretary's
      office, and beheld M'Dougall seated in an armchair, reading the newspaper
      of the day. I could not help connecting his presence there with some
      kindly intention towards me, and already regarded him as my friend. Major
      Barton stood at the secretary's side, and whispered from time to time in
      his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have before me certain information, sir,&rdquo; said the secretary,
      addressing me, &ldquo;that you were connected with parties who took an active
      part in the late rebellion in this country, and by them sent over to
      France to negotiate co-operation and assistance from that quarter,&rdquo;
       (Barton here whispered something, and the secretary resumed), &ldquo;and in
      continuance of this scheme are at present here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only to observe, sir, that I left Ireland a mere boy, when,
      whatever my opinions might have been, they were, I suspect, of small
      moment to his Majesty's Government; that I have served some years in the
      French army, during which period I neither corresponded with any one here,
      nor had intercourse with any from Ireland; and lastly, that I have come
      back unaccredited by any party, not having, as I believe, a single
      acquaintance in the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you still hold a commission in the French service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I resigned my grade as captain some time since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were your reasons for that step?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were of a purely personal nature, having no concern with politics of
      any sort; I should, therefore, ask of you not to demand them. I can only
      say, they reflect neither on my honor nor my loyalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His loyalty! Would you ask him, sir, how he applies the term, and to what
      sovereign and what government the obedience is rendered?&rdquo; said Barton,
      with a half smile of malicious meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, Barton; the question is most pertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I said loyalty, sir,&rdquo; said I, in answer, &ldquo;I confess I did not
      express myself as clearly as I intended. I meant, however, that as an
      Irishman, and a subject of his Majesty George the Third, as I now am, no
      act of mine in the French service ever compromised me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, surely you fought against the allies of your own country?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, sir. I speak only with reference to the direct interests of
      England. I was the soldier of the Emperor, but never a spy under his
      Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is amongst those who never claimed the indemnity? How is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of it; I never knew such an act was necessary. I am not
      guilty of any crime, nor do I see any reason to seek a favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well; the gracious intentions of the Crown lead us to look
      leniently on the past. A moderate bail for your appearance when called on,
      and your own recognizances for the same object, will suffice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite willing to do the latter; but as to bail, I repeat it, I have
      not one I could ask for such a service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No relative? no friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, young gentleman,&rdquo; said M'Dougall, speaking for the first
      time; &ldquo;recollect yourself. Try if you can't remember some one who would
      assist you at this conjuncture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basset was the only name I could think of; and however absurd the idea of
      a service from such a quarter, I deemed that, as my brother's agent, he
      would scarce refuse me. I thought that Barton gave a very peculiar grin as
      I mentioned the name; but my own securities being entered into, and a few
      formal questions answered, I was told I was at liberty to seek out the
      bail required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more in the streets, I turned my steps towards Basset's house, where
      I hoped, at all events, to learn some tidings of my brother. I was not
      long in arriving at the street, and speedily recognized the old house,
      whose cobwebbed windows and unwashed look reminded me of former times. The
      very sound of the heavy iron knocker awoke its train of recollections; and
      when the door was opened, and I saw the narrow hall, with its cracked lamp
      and damp, discolored walls, the whole heart-sinking with which they once
      inspired me came back again, and I thought of Tony Basset when his very
      name was a thing of terror to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Basset, I was told, was at court, and I was shown into the office to
      await his return. The gloomy little den,&mdash;I knew it well, with its
      dirty shelves of dirtier papers, its old tin boxes, and its rickety desk,
      at which two meanly-dressed starveling youths were busy writing. They
      turned a rapid glance towards me as I entered; and as they resumed their
      occupation, I could hear a muttered remark upon my dress and appearance,
      the purport of which I did not catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat for some time patiently, expecting Basset's arrival, but as the time
      stole by, I grew wearied with waiting, and determined on ascertaining, if
      I might, from the clerks, some intelligence concerning my brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any business with Mr. Burke?&rdquo; said the youth I addressed, while
      his features assumed an expression of vulgar jocularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was my brief reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't a letter do as well as a personal interview?&rdquo; said the other,
      with an air of affected courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; I replied, too deeply engaged in my own thoughts to mind
      their flippant impertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then mind you direct your letter 'Churchyard, Loughrea;' or, if you want
      to be particular, say 'Family vault.'&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;Is he dead? Is George dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's hard to say,&rdquo; interposed the other; &ldquo;but they've buried him,
      that's certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like a stunning blow, the shock of this news left me unable to speak or
      hear. A maze of confused thoughts crossed and jostled each other in my
      brain, and I could neither collect myself nor listen to what was said
      around me. My first clear memory was of a thousand little childish traits
      of love which had passed between us. Tokens of affection long forgotten
      now rushed freshly to my mind; and he whom a moment before I had condemned
      as wanting in all brotherly feeling, I now sorrowed for with true grief.
      The low and vulgar insolence of the speakers made no impression on me; and
      when, in answer to my questions, they narrated the manner of his death,&mdash;a
      fever contracted after some debauch at Oxford,&mdash;I only heard the
      tidings, but did not notice the unfeeling tone it was conveyed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      My brother dead! the only one of kith or kindred belonging to me. How
      slight the tie seemed but a few moments back! what would I not give for it
      now? Then, for the first time, did I know how the heart can heap up its
      stores of consolation in secrecy, and how unconsciously the mind can dwell
      on hopes it has never confessed even to itself. How I fancied to myself
      our meeting, and thought over the long pent-up affection years of absence
      had accumulated, now flowing in a gushing stream from heart to heart I The
      grave is indeed hallowed when the grass of the churchyard can cover all
      memory save that of love. We dwell on every good gift of the lost one, as
      though no unworthy thought could cross that little mound of earth, the
      barrier between two worlds. Sad and sorrow-struck, I covered my face with
      my hands, and did not notice that Mr. Basset had entered, and taken his
      place at the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice, every harsh tone of which I well remembered, first made me
      aware of his presence. I lifted my eyes, and there he stood, little
      changed indeed since I had seen him last. The hard lines about the mouth
      had grown deeper, the brow more furrowed, and the hair more mixed with
      gray, but in other respects he was the same. As I gazed at him I could not
      help fancying that time makes less impression on men of coarse, unfeeling
      mould, than on natures of a finer temper. The world's changes leave no
      trace on the stern surface of the one, while they are wearing deep tracks
      of sorrow in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insert the advertisement again, Simms,&rdquo; said he, addressing one of the
      clerks, &ldquo;and let it appear in some paper of the seaport towns. Among the
      Flemish or French smugglers who frequent them, there might be some one to
      give the information. They must be able to show that though Thomas Burke&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started at the sound of my name. The motion surprised him; he looked
      round and perceived me. Quick and piercing as his glance was, I could not
      trace any sign of recognition; although, as he scanned my features, and
      suffered his eyes to wander over my dress, I perceived that his was no
      mere chance or cursory observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said he, at length, &ldquo;is your business here with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I would speak with you in private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in here, then. Meanwhile, Sam, make out that deed; for we may go on
      without the proof of demise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Few and vague as the words were, their real meaning flashed on me, and I
      perceived that Mr. Basset was engaged in the search of some evidence of my
      death, doubtless to enable the heir-at-law to succeed to the estates of my
      brother. The moment the idea struck me, I felt assured of its certainty,
      and at once determined on the plan I should adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have inserted an advertisement regarding a Mr. Burke,&rdquo; said I, as
      soon as the door was closed, and we were alone together. &ldquo;What are the
      particular circumstances of which you desire proof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The place, date, and manner of his death,&rdquo; replied he, slowly; &ldquo;for
      though informed that such occurred abroad, an authentic evidence of the
      fact will save some trouble. Circumstances to identify the individual with
      the person we mean, of course, must be offered; showing whence he came,
      his probable age, and so on. For this intelligence I am prepared to pay
      liberally; at least a hundred pounds may be thought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a question of succession to some property, I have heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but the information is not of such moment as you may suppose,&rdquo;
       replied he, quickly, and with the wariness of his calling anticipating the
      value I might be disposed to place on my intelligence. &ldquo;We are satisfied
      with the fact of the death; and even were it otherwise, the individual
      most concerned is little likely to disprove the belief, his own reasons
      will probably keep him from visiting Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; I exclaimed, the word escaping my lips ere I could check its
      utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; resumed he. &ldquo;But this, of course, has no interest for you. Your
      accent bespeaks you a foreigner. Have you any information to offer on this
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; if we speak of the same individual, who may have left this country
      about 1800 as a boy of some fourteen years of age, and entered the 'École
      Polytechnique' of Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like enough. Continue, if you please; what became of him afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He joined the French service, attained the rank of captain, and then left
      the army; came back to Ireland, and now, sir, stands before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Basset never changed a muscle of his face as I made this declaration.
      So unmoved, so stolid was his look, that for a moment or two I believed
      him incredulous of my story. But this impression soon gave way, as with
      his eyes bent on me he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you, sir, I knew you the moment I passed you in the office
      without; but it might have fared ill with you to have let my recognition
      appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As how? I do not understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My clerks there might have given information for the sake of the reward;
      and once in Newgate, there was an end to all negotiation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must speak more intelligibly, sir, if you wish me to comprehend you.
      I am unaware of any circumstance which should threaten me with such a
      fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten Captain Crofts,&mdash;Montague Crofts?&rdquo; said Basset,
      in a low whisper, while a smile of insulting malice crossed his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I remember him well. What of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of him! He charges you with a capital felony,&mdash;a crime for
      which the laws have little pity here, whatever your French habits may have
      taught you to regard it. Yes; the attempt to assassinate an officer in his
      Majesty's service, when foiled by him in an effort to seduce the soldiery,
      is an offence which might have a place in your memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can the man be base enough to make such a charge as this against me,&mdash;a
      boy, as I then was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not alone; remember that fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; and most thankful am I for it. There is one, at least, can prove my
      innocence, if I can but discover him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find that a matter of some difficulty. Your worthy friend and
      early preceptor was transported five years since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow! I could better bear to hear that he was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many of your opinion on that head,&rdquo; said Basset, with a savage
      grin. &ldquo;But the fellow was too cunning for all the lawyers, and his
      conviction at last was only effected by a stratagem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stratagem!&rdquo; exclaimed I, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was neither more nor less. Darby was arraigned four several times, but
      always acquitted. Now it was defective evidence; now a lenient jury; now
      an informal indictment: but so was it, he escaped the meshes of the law,
      though every one knew him guilty of a hundred offences. At last Major
      Barton resolved on another expedient. Darby was arrested in Ennis; thrown
      into jail; kept four weeks in a dark cell, on prison fare; and at the end,
      one morning the hangman appeared to say his hour was come, and that the
      warrant for his execution had arrived. It was to take place, without judge
      or jury, within the four walls of the jail. The scheme succeeded; his
      courage fell, and he offered, if his life was spared, to plead guilty to
      any transportable felony for which the grand Jury would send up true
      bills. He did so, and was then undergoing the sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens! and can such iniquity be tolerated in a land where men
      call themselves Christians?&rdquo; exclaimed I, as I heard this to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Iniquity!&rdquo; repeated he, in mockery; &ldquo;to rid the country of a ruffian,
      stained with every crime,&mdash;a fellow mixed up in every outrage in the
      land? Is this your notion of iniquity? Not so do I reckon it. And if I
      have told you of it now, it is that you may learn that when loyal and
      well-affected men are trusted with the execution of the laws, the
      principle of justice is of more moment than the nice distinction of legal
      subtleties. You may learn a lesson from it worth acquiring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! how can it affect me or my fortunes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More nearly than you think. I have told you of the accusation which hangs
      over your head; weigh it well, and deliberate what are your chances of
      escape. We must not waste time in discussing your innocence. The jury who
      will try the cause will be more difficult of belief than you suspect;
      neither the opinions you are charged with, your subsequent escape, nor
      your career in France, will contribute to your exculpation, even had you
      evidence to adduce in your favor. But you have not; your only witness is
      equally removed as by death itself. On what do you depend, then? Conscious
      innocence! Nine out of every ten who mount the scaffold proclaim the same;
      but I never heard that the voice that cried it stifled the word 'guilty.'
      No, sir; I tell you solemnly, you will be condemned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of his voice as he spoke the last few words made my very blood
      run cold. The death of a soldier on the field of battle had no terrors for
      me; but the execrated fate of a felon I could not confront. The pallor of
      my cheek, the trembling of my limbs, must have betrayed my emotion; for
      even Basset seemed to pity me, and pressed me down into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one way, however, to avoid all the danger,&rdquo; said he, after a
      pause; &ldquo;an easy and a certain way both. You have heard of the
      advertisements for information respecting your death, which it was
      surmised had occurred abroad. Now you are unknown here,&mdash;without a
      single acquaintance to recognize or remember you; why should not you,
      under another name, come forward with these proofs? By so doing, you
      secure your own escape and can claim the reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! perjure myself that I may forfeit my inheritance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the inheritance,&rdquo; said he, sneeringly, &ldquo;your tenure does not
      promise a very long enjoyment of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it but a day,&mdash;an hour!&rdquo; exclaimed I, passionately; &ldquo;I will
      make no compromise with my honor. On their own heads be it who sentence an
      innocent man to death; better such, even on a scaffold, than a life of
      ignominy and vain regret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dark hours of a jail change men's sentiments wonderfully,&rdquo; said he,
      slowly. &ldquo;I have known some who faced death in its wildest and most
      appalling shape, shrink from it like cowards when it came in the guise of
      a common executioner. Come, sir, be advised by me; reflect at least on
      what I have said, and if there be any path in life where a moderate sum
      may assist you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, sir! I beg of you to be silent. It may be that your counsel is
      prompted by kindly feeling towards me; but if you would have me think so,
      say no more of this,&mdash;my mind is made up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until to-morrow, in any case; perhaps some other plan may suggest
      itself. What say you to America? Have you any objection to go there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you asked me the question an hour since, I had replied, 'None
      whatever.' Now it is different; my departure would be like the flight of a
      guilty man. I cannot do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better the flight than the fate of one,&rdquo; muttered Basset between his
      teeth, while at the same instant the sound of voices talking loudly
      together was heard in the hall without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think again, before it is too late. Remember what I have told you. Your
      opinions, your career, your associates, are not such as to recommend you
      to the favorable consideration of a jury. Is your case strong enough to
      oppose all these? Sir Montague will make liberal terms; he has no desire
      to expose the calamities of a family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Montague!&mdash;of whom do you speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Montague Crofts,&rdquo; said Basset, reddening, for he had unwittingly
      suffered the name to escape his lips. &ldquo;Are you ignorant that he is your
      relative? a distant one, it is true, but your nearest of kin
      notwithstanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the heir to the estate?&rdquo; said I, suddenly, as anew light flashed on
      my mind; &ldquo;the heir, in the event of my life lapsing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basset nodded an assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You played a deep game, sir,&rdquo; said I, drawing a long breath; &ldquo;but you
      never were near winning it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor you either,&rdquo; said he, throwing wide the door between the two rooms;
      &ldquo;I hear a voice without there, that settles the question forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant, Major Barton entered, followed by two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected I should find you here, sir,&rdquo; said he, addressing me. &ldquo;You
      need scarcely trouble my worthy friend for his bail; I arrest you now
      under a warrant of felony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A felony!&rdquo; exclaimed Basset, with a counterfeited astonishment in his
      look. &ldquo;Mr. Burke accused of such a crime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not utter a word; indignation and shame overpowered me, and merely
      motioning with my hand that I was ready to accompany him, I followed to
      the door, at which a carriage was standing, getting into which we drove
      towards Newgate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. THE PERIL AVERTED
    </h2>
    <p>
      If I have dwelt with unnecessary prolixity on this dark portion of my
      story, it is because the only lesson my life teaches has lain in similar
      passages. The train of evils which flows from one misdirection in early
      life,&mdash;the misfortunes which ensue from a single false and
      inconsiderate step,&mdash;frequently darken the whole subsequent career.
      This I now thought over in the solitude of my cell. However I could acquit
      myself of the crime laid to my charge, I could not so easily absolve my
      heart of the early folly which made me suppose that the regeneration of a
      land should be accomplished by the efforts of a sanguinary and bigoted
      rabble. To this error could I trace every false step I made in life,&mdash;to
      this cause attribute the long struggle I endured between my love of
      liberty and my detestation of mob rule; and yet how many years did it cost
      me to learn, that to alleviate the burdens of the oppressed may demand a
      greater exercise of tyranny than ever their rulers practised towards them.
      Like many others, I looked to France as the land of freedom; but where was
      despotism so unbounded! where the sway of one great mind so unlimited!
      They had bartered liberty for equality, and because the pressure was equal
      on all, they deemed themselves free; while the privileges of class with us
      suggested the sense of bondage to the poor man, whose actual freedom was
      yet unencumbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the daydreams of my boyhood, the ambition of military glory alone
      survived; and that lived on amid the dreary solitude of my prison,
      comforting many a lonely hour by memories of the past. The glittering
      ranks of the mounted squadrons; the deep-toned thunder of the artillery;
      the solid masses of the infantry, immovable beneath the rush of cavalry,&mdash;were
      pictures I could dwell on for hours and days, and my dearest wish could
      point to no higher destiny than to be once more a soldier in the ranks of
      France.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this time my mind seldom reverted to the circumstances of my
      imprisonment, nor did I feel the anxiety for the result my position might
      well have suggested. The conscious sense of my innocence kept the flame of
      hope alive, without suffering it either to flicker or vary. It burned like
      a steady fire within me, and made even the dark cells of a jail a place of
      repose and tranquillity. And thus time rolled on: the hours of pleasure
      and happiness to thousands, too short and flitting for the enjoyments they
      brought. They went by also to the prisoner, as to one who waits on the
      bank of the stream, nor knows what fortune may await him on his voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stubborn feeling of conscious right had prevented my taking even the
      ordinary steps for my defence, and the day of trial was now drawing nigh
      without any preparation on my part. I was ignorant how essential the
      habits and skill of an advocate are in the conduct of every case, however
      simple; and implicitly relied on my guiltlessness, as though men can read
      the heart of a prisoner and know its workings. M'Dougall, the only member
      of the bar I knew even by name, had accepted a judicial appointment in
      India, and was already on his way thither, so that I had neither friend
      nor adviser in my difficulty. Were it otherwise, I felt I could scarcely
      have bent my pride to that detail of petty circumstances which an advocate
      might deem essential to my vindication; and was actually glad to think
      that I should owe the assertion of my innocence to nothing less than the
      pure fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      When November at length arrived, I learned that the trial had been
      deferred to the following February; and so listless and indifferent had
      imprisonment made me, that I heard the intelligence without impatience or
      regret. The publicity of a court of justice, its exposure to the gaze and
      observation of the crowd who throng there, were subjects of more shrinking
      dread to my heart than the weight of an accusation which, though false,
      might peril my life; and for the first time I rejoiced that I was
      friendless. Yes! it brought balm and comfort to me to think that none
      would need to blush at my relationship nor weep over my fate. Sorrow has
      surely eaten deeply into our natures, when we derive pleasure and peace
      from what in happier circumstances are the sources of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me now hasten on. My reader will readily forgive me if I pass with
      rapid steps over a portion of my story, the memory of which has not yet
      lost its bitterness. The day at last came; and amid all the ceremonies of
      a prison I was marched from my cell to the dock. How strange the sudden
      revolution of feeling,&mdash;from the solitude and silence of a jail to
      the crowded court, teeming with looks of eager curiosity, dread, or
      perhaps compassion, all turned towards him, who himself, half forgetful of
      his condition, gazes on the great mass in equal astonishment and surprise!
    </p>
    <p>
      My thoughts at once recurred to a former moment of my life, when I stood
      accused among the Chouan prisoners before the tribunal of Paris. But
      though the proceedings were less marked by excitement and passion, the
      stern gravity of the English procedure was far more appalling; and in the
      absence of all which could stir the spirit to any effort of its own, it
      pressed with a more solemn dread on the mind of the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said I would not linger over this part of my life. I could not do
      so if I would. Real events, and the impressions they made upon me,&mdash;facts,
      and the passing emotions of my mind,&mdash;are strangely confused and
      commingled in my memory; and although certain minute and trivial things
      are graven in my recollection, others of moment have escaped me
      unrecorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual ceremonial went forward: the jury were impanelled, and the clerk
      of the Crown read aloud the indictment, to which my plea of &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo;
       was at once recorded; then the judge asked if I were provided with
      counsel, and hearing that I was not, appointed a junior barrister to act
      for me, and the trial began.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not the first person who, accused of a crime of which he felt
      innocent, yet was so overwhelmed by the statements of imputed guilt,&mdash;so
      confused by the inextricable web of truth and falsehood, artfully
      entangled.&mdash;that he actually doubted his own convictions when opposed
      to views so strongly at variance with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first emotion of the prisoner is a feeling of surprise to discover,
      that one utterly a stranger&mdash;the lawyer he has perhaps never seen,
      whose name he never so much as heard of&mdash;is perfectly conversant with
      his own history, and as it were by intuition seems acquainted with his
      very thoughts and motives. Tracing out not only a line of acting but of
      devising, he conceives a story of which the accused is the hero, and
      invests his narrative with all the appliances to belief which result from
      time and place and circumstance. No wonder that the very accusation should
      strike terror into the soul; no wonder that the statement of guilt should
      cause heart-sinking to him who, conscious that all is not untrue, may feel
      that his actions can be viewed in another and very different light to that
      which conscience sheds over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, so far as I remember, was the channel of my thoughts. At first mere
      astonishment at the accuracy of detail regarding my name, age, and
      condition in life, was uppermost; and then succeeded a sense of indignant
      anger at the charges laid against me; which yielded gradually to a feeling
      of confusion as the advocate continued; which again merged into a sort of
      dubious fear as I heard many trivial facts repeated, some of which my
      refreshed memory acknowledged as true, but of which my puzzled brain could
      not detect the inapplicability to sustain the accusation,&mdash;all ending
      in a chaos of bewilderment, where conscience itself was lost, and nothing
      left to guide or direct the reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      The counsel informed the jury that, although they were not placed in the
      box to try me on any charge of a political offence, they must bear in
      mind, that the murderous assault of which I was accused was merely part of
      a system organized to overthrow the Government; that, young as I then was,
      I was in intimate connection with the disaffected party which the mistaken
      leniency of the Crown had not thoroughly eradicated on the termination of
      the late rebellion, my constant companion being one whose crimes were
      already undergoing their but too merciful punishment in transportation for
      life; that, to tamper with the military, I had succeeded in introducing
      myself into the barrack, where I obtained the confidence of a weak-minded
      but good-natured officer of the regiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These schemes,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;were but partially successful. My
      distinguished client was then an officer of the corps; and with that
      ever-watchful loyalty which has distinguished him, he determined to keep a
      vigilant eye on this intruder, who, from circumstances of youth and
      apparent innocence, already had won upon the confidence of the majority of
      the regiment. Nor was this impression a false one. An event, apparently
      little likely to unveil a treasonable intention, soon unmasked the true
      character of the prisoner and the nature of his mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then proceeded to narrate with circumstantial accuracy the night in the
      George's Street barracks, when Hilliard, Crofts, and some others came with
      Bubbleton to his quarters to decide a wager between two of the parties.
      Calling the attention of the jury to this part of the case, he detailed
      the scene which occurred; and, if I could trust my memory, not a phrase,
      not a word escaped him which had been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was then, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at that instant, that the prisoner's
      habitual caution failed him, and in an unguarded moment developed the full
      story of his guilt. Captain Bubbleton lost his wager, of which my client
      was the winner. The habits of the service are peremptory in these matters;
      it was necessary that payment should be made at once. Bubbleton had not
      the means of discharging his debt, and while he looked around among his
      comrades for assistance, the prisoner steps forward and supplies the sum.
      Mark what followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sudden call of service now summoned the officers beneath; all save
      Crofts, who, not being on duty, had no necessity for accompanying them.
      The bank-note so opportunely furnished by the prisoner lay on the table;
      and this Crofts proceeded leisurely to open and examine before he left the
      room. Slowly unfolding the paper, he spread it out before him; and what,
      think you, gentlemen, did the paper display? A Bank of England bill for
      twenty pounds, you'll say, of course. Far from it, indeed! The paper was a
      French assignat, bearing the words, 'Payez au porteur la somme de deux
      mille livres.' Yes; the sum so carelessly thrown on the table by this
      youth was an order for eighty pounds, issued by the French Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember the period, gentlemen, when this occurred. We had just passed
      the threshold of a most fearful and sanguinary rebellion,&mdash;the
      tranquillity of the land scarce restored after a convulsion that shook the
      very constitution and the throne to their centres. The interference of
      France in the affairs of the country had not been a mere threat; her ships
      had sailed, her armies had landed, and though the bravery and the loyalty
      of our troops had made the expedition result in utter defeat and
      overthrow, the emissaries of the land of anarchy yet lingered on our
      shores, and disseminated that treason in secret which openly they dared
      not proclaim. If they were sparing of their blood, they were lavish of
      their gold; what they failed in courage they supplied in assignats. Large
      promises of gain, rich offers of booty, were rife throughout the land; and
      wherever disaffection lurked or rebellion lingered, the enemy of England
      found congenial allies. Nothing too base, nothing too low, for this
      confederacy of crime; neither was anything too lowly in condition or too
      humble in efficiency. Treason cannot choose its agents; it must take the
      tools which chance and circumstances offer: they may be the refuse of
      mankind, but if inefficient for good, they are not the less active for
      evil. Such a one was the youth who now stands a prisoner before you, and
      here was the price of his disloyalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words he held up triumphantly the French assignat, and waved it
      before the eyes of the court. However little the circumstances weighed
      within me, such was the impression manifestly produced upon the jury by
      this piece of corroborative evidence, that a thrill of anxiety for the
      result ran suddenly through me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until that moment I believed Darby had repossessed himself of the assignat
      when Crofts lay insensible on the ground; at least I remembered well that
      he stooped over him and appeared to take something from him. While I was
      puzzling my mind on this point, I did not remark that the lawyer was
      proceeding to impress on the jury the full force of conviction such a
      circumstance implied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The offer I had made to Crofts to barter the assignat for an English note;
      my urgent entreaty to have it restored to me; the arguments I had employed
      to persuade him that no suspicion could attach to my possession of it,&mdash;were
      all narrated with so little of exaggeration that I was actually unable to
      say what assertion I could object to, while I was conscious that the
      inferences sought to be drawn from them were false and unjust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having displayed with consummate skill the critical position this paper
      had involved me in, he took the opportunity of contrasting the anxiety I
      evinced for my escape from my difficulty, with the temperate conduct of my
      antagonist, whose loyalty left him no other course than to retain
      possession of the note, and inquire into the circumstances by which it
      reached my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irritated by the steady determination of Crofts, it was said that I
      endeavored by opprobrious epithets and insulting language to provoke a
      quarrel, which a sense of my inferiority as an antagonist rendered a thing
      impossible to be thought of. Baffled in every way, I was said to have
      rushed from the room, double-locking it on the outside, and hurried down
      the stairs and out of the barrack; not to escape, however, but with a
      purpose very different,&mdash;to return in a few moments accompanied by
      three fellows, whom I passed with the guard as men wishing to recruit. To
      ascend the stairs, unlock the door, and fall on the imprisoned officer,
      was the work of an instant. His defence, although courageous and resolute,
      was but brief. His sword being broken, he was felled by a blow of a
      bludgeon, and thus believed dead. The ruffians ransacked his pockets, and
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same countersign which admitted, passed them out as they went; and
      when morning broke the wounded man was found weltering in his blood, but
      with life still remaining, and strength enough to recount what had
      occurred. By a mere accident, it was stated, the French bank-note had not
      been consigned to his pocket, but fell during the struggle, and was
      discovered the next day on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the leading features of an accusation, which, however
      improbable while thus briefly and boldly narrated, hung together with a
      wonderful coherence in the speech of the lawyer, supported as they were by
      the number of small circumstances corroboratory of certain immaterial
      portions of the story. Thus, the political opinions I professed; the
      doubtful&mdash;nay, equivocal&mdash;position I occupied; the intercourse
      with France or Frenchmen, as proved by the <i>billet de banque</i>; my
      sudden disappearance after the event, and my escape thither, where I
      continued to live until, as it was alleged, I believed that years had
      eradicated all trace of, if not my crime, myself,&mdash;such were the
      statements displayed with all the specious inferences of habitual
      plausibility, and to confirm which by evidence Sir Montague Crofts was
      called to give his testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of expectancy through the court as this well-known
      individual's name was pronounced; and in a few moments the throng around
      the inner bar opened, and a tall figure appeared upon the witness table.
      The same instant that I caught sight of his features he had turned his
      glance on me, and we stood for some seconds confronting each other. Mutual
      defiance seemed the gage between us; and I saw, with a thrill of savage
      pleasure, that after a minute or so his cheek flushed, and he averted his
      face and appeared ill at ease and uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the first questions of the lawyer he answered with evident constraint,
      and in a low, subdued voice; but soon recovering his self-possession, gave
      his testimony freely and boldly, corroborating by his words all the
      statements of his advocate. By both the court and the jury he was heard
      with attention and deference; and when he took a passing occasion to
      allude to his loyalty and attachment to the constitution, the senior judge
      interrupted him by saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On that point, Sir Montague, no second opinion can exist. Your character
      for unimpeachable honor is well known to the court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The examination was brief, lasting scarcely half an hour; and when the
      young lawyer came forward to put some questions as cross-examination, his
      want of instruction and ignorance were at once seen, and the witness was
      dismissed almost immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Montague's advocate declined calling any other witness. The regiment
      to which his client then belonged was on foreign service; but he felt
      satisfied that the case required nothing in addition to the evidence the
      jury had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments of deliberation ensued among the members of the bench; and
      then the senior judge called on my lawyer to proceed with the defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young barrister rose with diffidence, and expressed in few words his
      inability to rebut the statements that had been made by any evidence in
      his power to produce. &ldquo;The prisoner, my lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has confided
      nothing to me of his case. I am ignorant of everything, save what has
      taken place in open court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, my lord,&rdquo; said I, interrupting. &ldquo;The facts of this unhappy
      circumstance are known but to three individuals. You have already heard
      the version which one of them has given; you shall now hear mine. The
      third, whose testimony might incline the balance in my favor, is, I am
      told, no longer in this country; and I have only to discharge the debt I
      feel due to myself and to my own honor, by narrating the real occurrence,
      and leave the issue in your hands, to deal with as your consciences may
      dictate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the steadiness of purpose truth inspires, and in few words, I
      narrated the whole of my adventure with Crofts, down to the moment of
      Darby's sudden appearance. I told of what passed between us; and how the
      altercation, that began in angry words, terminated in a personal struggle,
      where, as the weaker, I was overcome, and lay beneath the weapon of my
      antagonist, by which already I had received a severe and dangerous wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hesitate here, my lords,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;before I spoke of one who
      then came to my aid, if I did not know that he is already removed by a
      heavy sentence, both from the penalty his gallant conduct might call down
      on him, and the enmity which the prosecutor would as certainly pursue him
      with. But he is beyond the reach of either, and I may speak of him
      freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then told of Darby's appearance that night in the barrack, disguised as
      a ballad-singer; how in this capacity he passed the sentry, and was
      present in the room when the officers entered to decide the wager; that he
      had quitted it soon after their arrival, and only returned on hearing the
      noise of the scuffle between Crofts and myself. The struggle itself I
      remembered but imperfectly, but so far as my memory bore me out,
      recapitulated to the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will relate, my lords,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the few events which followed,&mdash;not
      that they can in any wise corroborate the plain statement I have made, nor
      indeed that they bear, save remotely, on the events mentioned; but I will
      do so in the hope,&mdash;a faint hope it is,&mdash;that in this court
      there might be found some one person who could add his testimony to mine,
      and say, 'This is true; to that I can myself bear witness.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this brief preface, I told how Darby had brought me to a house in an
      obscure street, in which a man, apparently dying, was stretched upon a
      miserable bed; that while my wound was being dressed, a car came to the
      door with the intention of conveying the sick man away somewhere. This,
      however, was deemed impossible, so near did his last hour appear; and in
      his place I was taken off, and placed on board the vessel bound for
      France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my career in that country it is needless that I should speak; it can
      neither throw light upon the events which preceded it, nor have any
      interest for the court My commission as a captain of the Imperial Hussars
      may, however, testify the position that I occupied; while the certificate
      of the minister of war on the back will show that I quitted the service
      voluntarily, and with honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The court would advise you, sir,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;not to advert to
      circumstances which, while they contribute nothing to your exculpation,
      may have a very serious effect on the minds of the jury against you. Have
      you any witnesses to call?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause of some minutes ensued, when the only sounds in the court were the
      whispering tones of Crofts's voice, as he said something into his
      counsel's ear. The lawyer rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My task, my lords,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a short one. Indeed, in all probability,
      I need not trouble either your lordships or the jury with an additional
      word on a case where the evidence so conclusively establishes the guilt of
      the accused, and where attempt to contradict it has been so abortive.
      Never, perhaps, was a story narrated within the walls of a court so full
      of improbable&mdash;might I not almost say impossible&mdash;events, as
      that of the prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then recapitulated, with rapid but accurate detail, the principal
      circumstances of my story, bestowing some brief comment on each as he
      went. He sneered at the account of the struggle, and turned the whole
      description of the contest with Crofts into ridicule,&mdash;calling on the
      jury to bestow a glance on the manly strength and vigorous proportions of
      his client, and then remember the age of his antagonist,&mdash;a boy of
      fourteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot, gentlemen (I ask your pardon), he confesses to one ally,&mdash;this
      famous piper. I really did hope that was a name we had done with forever.
      I indulged the dream, that among the memories of an awful period this was
      never to recur; but unhappily the expectation was delusive. The fellow is
      brought once more before us; and perhaps, for the first time in his long
      life of iniquity, charged with a crime he did not commit.&rdquo; In a few
      sentences he explained that a large reward was at that very moment offered
      for the apprehension of Darby, who never would have ventured under any
      disguise to approach the capital, much less trust himself within the walls
      of a barrack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tissue of wild and inconsistent events which the prisoner has
      detailed as following the assault, deserves no attention at my hands.
      Where was this house? What was the street? Who was this doctor of which he
      speaks? And the sick man, how was he called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember his name well; it is the only one I remember among all I
      heard,&rdquo; said I, from the dock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hear it, then,&rdquo; said the lawyer, half contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daniel Fortescue was the name he was called by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely was the name uttered by me, when Crofts leaned back in his seat
      and became pale as death; while, stretching out his hand, he took hold of
      the lawyer's gown and drew him towards him. For a second or two he
      continued to speak with rapid utterance in the advocate's ear; and then
      covering his face with his handkerchief, leaned his head on the rail
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is necessary, my lords,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;that I should explain the
      reason of my client's emotion, and at the same time unveil the baseness
      which has dictated this last effort of the prisoner, if not to injure the
      reputation, to wound the feelings, of my client. The individual whose name
      has been mentioned was the half brother of my client; and whose unhappy
      connection with the disastrous events of the year '98 involved him in a
      series of calamities which ended in his death, which took place in the
      year 1800, but some months earlier than the circumstance which we now are
      investigating. The introduction of this unhappy man's name was, then, a
      malignant effort of the prisoner to insult the feelings of my client, on
      which your lordships and the jury will place its true value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of disapprobation ran through the crowded court as these words
      were spoken; but whether directed against me or against the comment of the
      lawyer I could not determine; nor, such was the confusion I then felt,
      could I follow the remainder of the advocate's address with anything like
      clearness. At last he concluded; and the chief justice, after a whispered
      conversation with his brethren of the bench, thus began:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of the jury, the case which you have this day to try, to my
      mind presents but one feature of doubt and difficulty. The great fact for
      your consideration is, to determine to which of two opposite and
      conflicting testimonies you will accord your credence. On the one side you
      have the story of the prosecutor, a man of position and character, high in
      the confidence of honorable men, and invested with all the attributes of
      rank and station; on the other, you have a narrative strongly coherent in
      some parts, equally difficult to account for in others, given by the
      prisoner, whose life, even by his own showing, has none of those
      recommendations to your good opinions which are based on loyalty and
      attachment to the constitution of these realms. Both testimonies are
      unsupported by any collateral evidence. The prosecutor's regiment is in
      India, and the only witnesses he could adduce are many thousand miles off.
      The prisoner appeals also to the absent, but with less of reason; for if
      we could call this man, M'Keown, before us,&mdash;if, I say, we had this
      same Darby M'Keown in court&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tremendous uproar in the hall without drowned the remainder of the
      sentence; and although the crier loudly proclaimed silence, and the bench
      twice interposed its authority to enforce it, the tumult continued, and
      eventually extended within the court itself, where all semblance of
      respect seemed suddenly annihilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this continues one moment longer,&rdquo; exclaimed the chief justice, &ldquo;I
      will commit to Newgate the very first disorderly person I can discover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The threat, however, did but partially calm the disturbance, which, in a
      confused murmur, prevailed from the benches of the counsel to the very
      galleries of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What means this?&rdquo; said the judge, in a voice of anger. &ldquo;Who is it that
      dares to interfere with the administration of justice here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A witness,&mdash;a witness, my lord,&rdquo; called out several voices from the
      passage of the court; while a crowd pushed violently forward, and came
      struggling onwards till the leading figures were pressed over the inner
      bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the judge repeated his question, while he made a signal for the
      officer of the court to approach him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis me, my lord,&rdquo; shouted a deep-toned voice from the middle of the
      crowd. &ldquo;Your lordship was asking for Darby M'Keown, and it isn't himself's
      ashamed of the name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A perfect yell of approval broke from the ragged mob, which now filled
      every avenue and passage of the court, and even jammed up the stairs and
      the entrance halls. And now, raised upon the shoulders of the crowd, Darby
      appeared, borne aloft in triumph; his broad and daring face, bronzed with
      sun and weather, glowed with a look of reckless effrontery, which no awe
      of the court nor any fear for himself was able to repress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of my own sensations while this scene was enacting I need not speak; and
      as I gazed at the weather-beaten features of the hardy piper, it demanded
      every effort of my reason to believe in the testimony of my eyesight. Had
      he come back from death itself the surprise would scarcely have been
      greater. Meanwhile the tumult was allayed; and the lawyers on either side&mdash;for,
      now that a glimmer of hope appeared, my advocate had entered with spirit
      on his duties&mdash;were discussing the admissibility of evidence at the
      present stage of the proceedings. This point being speedily established in
      my favor, another and a graver question arose: how far the testimony of a
      convicted felon&mdash;for such the lawyer at once called Darby&mdash;could
      be received as evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cases were quoted and authorities shown to prove that such cannot be heard
      as witnesses,&mdash;that they are among those whom the law pronounces
      infamous and unworthy of credit; and while the lawyer continued to pour
      forth on this topic a perfect ocean of arguments, he was interrupted by
      the court, who affirmed the opinion, and concurred in his view of the
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only remains, then, my lord,&rdquo; said my counsel, &ldquo;for the Crown to
      establish the identity of the individual&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing easier,&rdquo; interposed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon; I was about to add,&mdash;and produce the record of his
      conviction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last seemed a felling blow; for although the old lawyer never evinced
      here or at any other time the slightest appearance of discomfiture at any
      opposition, I could see by the puckering of the deep lines around his
      mouth that he felt vexed and annoyed by this new suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      An eager and animated discussion ensued, in which my advocate was assisted
      by the advice of some senior counsel; and again the point was ruled in my
      favor, and Darby M'Keown was desired to mount the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It required all the efforts of the various officers of the court to
      repress another outbreak of mob enthusiasm at the decision; for already
      the trial had assumed a feature perfectly distinct from any common
      infraction of the law. Its political bearing had long since imparted a
      character of party warfare to the whole proceeding; and while Sir Montague
      Crofts found his well-wishers among the better dressed and more
      respectable persons present, a much more numerous body of supporters
      claimed me as their own, and in defiance of all the usages and solemnity
      of the place, did not scruple to bestow on me looks and even words of
      encouragement at every stage of the trial. Darby's appearance was the
      climax of this popular enthusiasm. There were few who had not seen, or at
      least heard of, the celebrated piper in times past. His daring infraction
      of the law; his reputed skill in evading detection; his acquaintance with
      every clew and circumstance of the late rebellion; the confidence he
      enjoyed among all the leaders&mdash;had made him a hero in a land where
      such qualities are certain of obtaining their due estimation. And now, the
      reckless effrontery of his presence as a witness in a court of justice
      while the sentence of transportation still hung over him, was a claim to
      admiration none refused to acknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      His air and demeanor as he took his seat on the table seemed an
      acknowledgment of the homage rendered him: for though, as he placed his
      worn and ragged hat beside his feet, and stroked down his short black hair
      on his forehead, a careless observer might have suspected him of feeling
      awed and abashed by the presence in which he sat, one more conversant with
      his countrymen would have detected in the quiet leer of his roguish black
      eye, and a certain protrusion of his thick under lip, that Darby was as
      perfectly at his ease there as the eminent judge was who now fixed his
      eyes upon him. A short, but not disrespectful nod was the only notice he
      bestowed on me; and then concealing his joined hands within his sleeves,
      and drawing his legs back beneath the chair, he assumed that attitude of
      mock humility your least bashful Irishman is so commonly fond of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The veteran barrister was meanwhile surveying the witness with the
      peculiar scrutiny of his caste: he looked at him through his spectacles,
      and then he stared at him above them; he measured him from head to foot,
      his eye dwelling on every little circumstance of his dress or demeanor, as
      though to catch some clew to his habits of thinking or acting. Never did a
      matador survey the brawny animal with which he was about to contend in
      skill or strength with more critical acumen than did the lawyer regard
      Darby the Blast. Nor was the object of this examination unaware of it;
      very far from this, indeed. He seemed pleased by the degree of attention
      bestowed on him, and felt all the flattery such notice conveyed; but while
      doing so, you could only detect his satisfaction in an occasional sidelong
      look of drollery, which, brief and fleeting as it was, had still a
      numerous body of admirers through the court, whose muttered expressions of
      &ldquo;Divil fear ye, Darby! but ye 're up to them any day;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Faix! 't is
      himself cares little about them!&rdquo; showed they had no lack of confidence in
      the piper.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is M'Keown, sir?&rdquo; said the lawyer, with that abruptness which
      so often succeeds in oversetting the balance of a witness's
      self-possession. &ldquo;Yes, sir; Darby M'Keown.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you ever go by any other
      than this?&rdquo; &ldquo;They do call me 'Darby the Blast' betimes, av that 'a a
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the only other name you have been called by?&rdquo; &ldquo;I misremember
      rightly, it's so long since I was among friends and acquaintances; but if
      yer honor would remind me a little, maybe I could tell.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, were you
      ever called 'Larry the Flail?'&rdquo; &ldquo;Faix, I was,&rdquo; replied he, laughing;
      &ldquo;divil a doubt of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come by the name of 'Larry the Flail'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They gave me the name up at Mulhuldad there, for bating one M'Clancy with
      a flail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good reason. So you got the name because you beat a certain
      M'Clancy with a flail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say that; I only said they gave me the name because they said I
      bate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you ever called 'Fire-the-Haggard'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was, often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For no reason, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a may son. The boys said it in sport, just as they talk of yer
      honor out there in the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean,&mdash;talk of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I heard them say myself, as I was coming in, that you wor a clever
      man and a 'cute lawyer. They do be always humbugging that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A titter ran round the benches of the barristers at this speech, which was
      delivered with a naïve simplicity that would deceive many.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were a United Irishman, Mr. M'Keown, I believe?&rdquo; rejoined the
      counsel, with a frown of stern intimidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; and a White Boy, and a Defender, and a Thrasher besides. I was
      in all the fun them times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Thrashers are the fellows, I believe, who must beat any man they are
      appointed to attack; isn't that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that, if I was mentioned to you as a person to be assaulted, although
      I had never done you any injury, you 'd not hesitate to waylay me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I wouldn't do that. I'd not touch yer honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come; what do you mean? Why wouldn't you touch me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I' d rather not tell, av it was plazing to ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell, sir; speak out! Why wouldn't you attack me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say, sir,&rdquo; said Darby,&mdash;and as he spoke, his voice assumed a
      peculiar lisp, meant to express great modesty,&mdash;&ldquo;they say, sir, that
      when a man has a big wart on his nose there, like yer honor, it's not
      lucky to bate him, for that's the way the divil marks his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the decorum of the court gave way entirely, and the unwashed
      faces which filled the avenues and passages were all expanded in open
      laughter; nor was it easy to restore order again amid the many marks of
      approval and encouragement bestowed on Darby by his numerous admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember where you are, sir,&rdquo; said the judge, severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; said Darby, with an air of submission. &ldquo;'T is the first
      time I was ever in sich a situation as this. I 'm much more at my ease
      when I 'm down in the dock there; it's what I 'm most used to, God help
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whining tone in which he delivered this mock lament on his misfortunes
      occasioned another outbreak of the mob, who were threatened with expulsion
      from the court if any future interruption took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were, then, a member of every illegal society of the time, Mr.
      Darby?&rdquo; said the lawyer, returning to the examination. &ldquo;Is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of them, anyhow,&rdquo; was the cool reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You took an active part in the doings of the year '98 also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth I did,&mdash;mighty active. I walked from beyant Castlecomer one
      day to Dublin to see a trial here. Be the same token, it was Mr. Curran
      made a hare of yer honor that day. Begorrah I wonder ye ever held up yer
      head after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a burst of laughter at the recollection seemed to escape Darby so
      naturally, that its contagious effects were felt throughout the assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a wit, Mr. M'Keown, I fancy, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad I 'm not, sir; very little of that same would have kept out of this
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you came here to serve a friend,&mdash;a very old friend, he calls
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; said Darby, with an energy of tone and manner very different
      from what he had hitherto used. &ldquo;Does Master Tom say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the poor fellow's cheek flushed, and his eyes sparkled with proud
      emotion, I could perceive that the lawyer's face underwent a change
      equally rapid. A look of triumph at having at length discovered the
      assailable point of the witness's temperament now passed over his pale
      features, and gave them an expression of astonishing intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very natural thing it is, Darby, that he should call you so. You were
      companions at an early period,&mdash;at least of his life;
      fellow-travellers, too, if I don't mistake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although these words were spoken in a tone of careless freedom, and
      intended to encourage Darby to some expansion on the same theme, the
      cunning fellow had recovered all his habitual self-possession, and merely
      answered, if answer it could be called,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a poor man, sir, and lived by the pipes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The advocate and the witness exchanged looks at this moment, in which
      their relative positions were palpably conveyed. Each seemed to say it was
      a drawn battle; but the lawyer returned with vigor to the charge; desiring
      Darby to mention the manner in which our first acquaintance began, and how
      the intimacy was originally formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He narrated with clearness and accuracy every step of our early
      wanderings; and while never misstating a single fact, contrived to exhibit
      my career as totally devoid of any participation in the treasonable doings
      of the period. Indeed, he laid great stress on the fact that my
      acquaintance with Charles de Meudon had withdrawn me from all relations
      with the insurgent party, between whom and the French allies feelings of
      open dislike and distrust existed. Of the scene at the barrack his account
      varied in nothing from that I had already given; nor was all the ingenuity
      of a long and intricate cross-examination able to shake his testimony in
      the most minute particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, then, you know Sir Montague Crofts? It is quite clear that you
      cannot mistake a person with whom you had a struggle such as you speak
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, I'd know his skin upon a bush,&rdquo; said Darby, &ldquo;av he was like what I
      remember him; but sure he may be changed since that. They tell me I'm
      looking ould myself; and no wonder. Hunting kangaroos wears the
      constitution terribly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look around the court, now, and say if he be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darby rose from his seat, and shading his eyes with his hand, took a
      deliberate survey of the court. Though well knowing, from past experience,
      in what part of the assembly the person he sought would probably be, he
      seized the occasion to scrutinize the features of the various persons,
      whom under no other pretence could he have examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not on the bench, sir, you need look for him,&rdquo; said the lawyer, as
      M'Keown remained for a considerable time with his eyes bent in that
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad there's no knowing,&rdquo; rejoined Darby, doubtfully; &ldquo;av he was dressed
      up that way, I wouldn't know him from an old ram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned round as he said this, and gazed steadfastly towards the bar. It
      was an anxious moment for me: should Darby make any mistake in the
      identity of Crofts, his whole testimony would be so weakened in the
      opinion of the jury as to be nearly valueless. I watched his eyes,
      therefore, as they ranged over the crowded mass, with a palpitating heart;
      and when at last his glance settled on a far part of the court, very
      distant from that occupied by Crofts, I grew almost sick with apprehension
      lest he should mistake another for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the lawyer; &ldquo;do you see him now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, it's humbugging me yez are,&rdquo; said Darby, roughly, while he threw
      himself down into his chair in apparent ill temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud burst of laughter broke from the bar at this sudden ebullition of
      passion, so admirably feigned that none suspected its reality; and while
      the sounds of mirth were subsiding, Darby dropped his head, and placed his
      hand above his ear. &ldquo;There it is, by gorra; there's no mistaking that
      laugh, anyhow,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;there's a screech in it might plaze an owl.&rdquo;
       And with that he turned abruptly round and faced the bench where Crofts
      was seated. &ldquo;I heard it a while ago, but I couldn't say where. That's the
      man,&rdquo; said he, pointing with his finger to Crofts, who seemed actually to
      cower beneath his piercing glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, sir, you are on your solemn oath. Will you swear that the
      gentleman there is Sir Montague Crofts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about Sir Montague,&rdquo; said Darby, composedly, while rising
      he walked over towards the edge of the table where Crofts was sitting,
      &ldquo;but I'll swear that's the same Captain Crofts that I knocked down while
      he was shortening his sword to run it through Master Burke; and by the
      same token, he has a cut in the skull where he fell on the fender.&rdquo; And
      before the other could prevent it, he stretched out his hand, and placed
      it on the back of the crown of Crofts's head. &ldquo;There it is, just as I
      tould you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sensation these words created in the court was most striking, and even
      the old lawyer appeared overwhelmed at the united craft and consistency of
      the piper. The examination was resumed; but Darby's evidence tallied so
      accurately with my statement that its continuance only weakened the case
      for the prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sudden flash of the lightning will sometimes disclose what in the
      long blaze of noonday has escaped the beholder, so will conviction break
      unexpectedly upon the human mind from some slight but striking
      circumstance which comes with the irresistible force of unpremeditated
      truthfulness. From that moment it was clear the jury to a man were with
      Darby. They paid implicit attention to all he said, and made notes of
      every trivial fact he mentioned; while he, as if divining the impression
      he had made, became rigorously cautious that not a particle of his
      evidence could be shaken, nor the effect of his testimony weakened by even
      a passing phrase of exaggeration. It was, indeed, a phenomenon worth
      studying, to see this fellow, whose natural disposition was the
      irrepressible love of drollery and recklessness,&mdash;whose whole heart
      seemed bent on the indulgence of his wayward, careless humor,&mdash;suddenly
      throw off every eccentricity of his character, and become a steady and
      accurate witness, delivering his evidence carefully and cautiously, and
      never suffering his own leanings to repartee, nor the badgering allusions
      of his questioner, to draw him for a moment away from the great object he
      had set before him; resisting every line, every bait, the cunning lawyer
      threw out to seduce him into that land of fancy so congenial to an
      Irishman's temperament, he was firm against all temptation, and even
      endured that severest of all tests to the forbearance of his country,&mdash;he
      suffered the laugh more than once to be raised at his expense, without an
      effort to retort on his adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The examination lasted three hours; and at its conclusion, every fact I
      stated had received confirmation from Darby's testimony, down to the
      moment when we left the barrack together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, M'Keown,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;I am about to call your recollection,
      which is so wonderfully accurate that it can give you no trouble in
      remembering, to a circumstance which immediately followed the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he got thus far, Crofts leaned over and drew the counsel towards him
      while he whispered some words rapidly in his ear. A brief dialogue ensued
      between them; at the conclusion of which the lawyer turned round, and
      addressing Darby, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go down, sir; I 've done with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said the
      young barrister on my side, who quickly perceived that the interruption
      had its secret object. &ldquo;My learned friend was about to ask you concerning
      something which happened after you left the barrack; and although he has
      changed his mind on the subject, we on this side would be glad to hear
      what you have to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darby's eyes flashed with unwonted brilliancy; and I thought I caught a
      glance of triumphant meaning towards Crofts, as he began his recital,
      which was in substance nothing more than what the reader already knows.
      When he came to the mention of Fortescue's name, however, Crofts, whose
      excitement was increasing at each moment, lost all command over himself,
      and cried out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's false! every word untrue! The man was dead at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The court rebuked the interruption, and Darby went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord; he was alive. But Mr. Crofts is not to blame, for he
      believed he was dead; and, more than that, he thought he took the sure way
      to make him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words produced the greatest excitement throughout the court; and an
      animated discussion ensued, how far the testimony could go to inculpate a
      party not accused. It was ruled, at last, the evidence should be heard, as
      touching the case on trial, and not immediately as regarded Crofts. And
      then Darby began a recital, of which I had never heard a syllable before,
      nor had I conceived the slightest suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story, partly told in narrative form, partly elicited by questioning,
      was briefly this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel Fortescue was the son of a Roscommon gentleman of large fortune, of
      whom also Crofts was the illegitimate child. The father, a man of high
      Tory politics, had taken a most determined part against the patriotic
      party in Ireland, to which his son Daniel had shown himself, on more than
      one occasion, favorable. The consequence was, a breach of affection
      between them; widened into an actual rupture, by the old man, who was a
      widower, taking home to his house the illegitimate son, and announcing to
      his household that he would leave him everything he could in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Daniel, the blow was all that he needed to precipitate his ruin. He
      abandoned the university, where already he had distinguished himself, and
      threw himself heart and soul into the movement of the &ldquo;United Irish&rdquo;
       party. At first, high hopes of an independent nation,&mdash;a separate
      kingdom, with its own train of interests, and its own sphere of power and
      influence,&mdash;was the dream of those with whom he associated. But as
      events rolled on it was found, that to mature their plans it was necessary
      to connect themselves with the masses, by whose agency the insurrectionary
      movement was to be effected; and in doing so, they discovered, that
      although theories of liberty and independence, high notions of pure
      government, may have charms for men of intellect and intelligence, to the
      mob the price of a rebellion must be paid down in the sterling coin of
      pillage and plunder,&mdash;or even, worse, the triumphant dominion of the
      depraved and the base over the educated and the worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many who favored the patriotic cause, as it was called, became so
      disgusted at the low associates and base intercourse the game of party
      required, that they abandoned the field at once, leaving to others, less
      scrupulous or more ardent, the path they could not stoop to follow. It was
      probable that young Fortescue might have been among these, had he been
      left to the guidance of his own judgment and inclination; for, as a man of
      honor and intelligence, he could not help feeling shocked at the demands
      made by those who were the spokesmen of the people. But this course he was
      not permitted to take, owing to the influence of a man who had succeeded
      in obtaining the most absolute power over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a certain Maurice Mulcahy, a well-known member of the various
      illegal clubs of the day, and originally a country schoolmaster. Mulcahy
      it was who first infected Fortescue's mind with the poison of this party,&mdash;now
      lending him volumes of the incendiary trash with which the press teemed;
      now newspapers, whose articles were headed, &ldquo;Orange outrage on a harmless
      and unresisting peasantry!&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Another sacrifice of the people to the
      bloody vengeance of the Saxon!&rdquo; By these, his youthful mind became
      interested in the fate of those he believed to be treated with reckless
      cruelty and oppression; while, as he advanced in years, his reason was
      appealed to by those great and spirit-stirring addresses which Grattan and
      Curran were continually delivering, either in the senate or at the bar,
      and wherein the most noble aspirations after liberty were united with
      sentiments breathing love of country and devoted patriotism. To connect
      the garbled and lying statements of a debased newspaper press with the
      honorable hopes and noble conceptions of men of mind and genius, was the
      fatal process of his political education; and never was there a time when
      such a delusion was more easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mulcahy, now stimulating the boyish ardor of a high-spirited youth, now
      flattering his vanity by promises of the position one of his ancient name
      and honored lineage must assume in the great national movement, gradually
      became his directing genius, swaying every resolution and ruling every
      determination of his mind. He never left his victim for a moment; and
      while thus insuring the unbounded influence he exercised, he gave proof of
      a seeming attachment, which Fortescue confidently believed in. Mulcahy,
      too, never wanted for money; alleging that the leaders of the plot knew
      the value of Fortescue's alliance, and were willing to advance him any
      sums he needed, he supplied the means of every extravagance a wild and
      careless youth indulged in, and thus riveted the chain of his bondage to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the rebellion broke out, Fortescue, like many more, was horror-struck
      at the conduct of his party. He witnessed hourly scenes of cruelty and
      bloodshed at which his heart revolted, but to avow his compassion for
      which would have cost him his life on the spot. He was in the stream,
      however, and must go with the torrent; and what will not stern necessity
      compel? Daily intimacy with the base-hearted and the low, hourly
      association with crime, and perhaps more than either, despair of success,
      broke him down completely, and with the blind fatuity of one predestined
      to evil, he became careless what happened to him, and indifferent to
      whatever fate was before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, between him and his associates there lay a wide gulf. The tree,
      withered and blighted as it was, still preserved some semblance of its
      once beauty; and among that mass of bigotry and bloodshed, his nature
      shone forth conspicuously as something of a different order of being. To
      none was this superiority more insulting than to the parties themselves.
      So long as the period of devising and planning the movement of an
      insurrection lasts, the presence of a gentleman, or a man of birth or
      rank, will be hailed with acclamation and delight. Let the hour of acting
      arrive, however, and the scruples of an honorable mind, or the repugnance
      of a high-spirited nature, will be treated as cowardice by those who only
      recognized bravery in deeds of blood, and know no heroism save when allied
      to cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortescue became suspected by his party. Hints were circulated, and rumors
      reached him, that he was watched; that it was no time for hanging back. He
      who sacrificed everything for the cause to be thus accused! He consulted
      Mulcahy; and to his utter discomfiture discovered that even his old ally
      and adviser was not devoid of doubt regarding him. Something must be done,
      and that speedily,&mdash;he cared not what. Life had long ceased to
      interest him either by hope or fear. The only tie that bound him to
      existence was the strange desire to be respected by those his heart
      sickened at the thought of.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attack was at that time planned against the house and family of a
      Wexford gentleman, whose determined opposition to the rebel movement had
      excited all their hatred. Fortescue demanded to be the leader of that
      expedition; and was immediately named to the post by those who were glad
      to have the opportunity of testing his conduct by such an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attack took place at night,&mdash;a scene of the most fearful and
      appalling cruelty, such as the historian yet records among the most
      dreadful of that dreadful period. The house was burned to the ground, and
      its inmates butchered, regardless of age or sex. In the effort to save a
      female from the flames, Fortescue was struck down by one of his party;
      while another nearly cleft his chest across with a cut of a large knife.
      He fell, covered with blood, and lay seemingly dead. When his party
      retreated, however, he summoned strength to creep under shelter of a
      ditch, and lay there till near daybreak, when he was found by another gang
      of the rebel faction, who knew nothing of the circumstances of his wound,
      and carried him away to a place of safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some months he lay dangerously ill. Hectic fever, consequent on long
      suffering, brought him to the very brink of the grave; and at last he
      managed by stealth to reach Dublin, where a doctor well known to the party
      resided, and under whose care he ultimately recovered, and succeeded at
      last in taking a passage to America. Meanwhile his death was currently
      believed, and Crofts was everywhere recognized as the heir to the fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mulcahy, of whom it is necessary to speak a few words, was soon after
      apprehended on a charge of rebellion, and sentenced to transportation. He
      appealed to many who had known him, as he said, in better times, to speak
      to his character. Among others, Captain Crofts&mdash;so he then was&mdash;was
      summoned. His evidence, however, was rather injurious than favorable to
      the prisoner; and although not in any way influencing the sentence, was
      believed by the populace to have mainly contributed to its severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was, in substance, the singular story which was now told before the
      court,&mdash;told without any effort at concealment or reserve; and to the
      proof of which M'Keown was willing to proceed at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, my lord,&rdquo; said Darby, as he concluded, &ldquo;is a good time and place to
      give back to Mr. Crofts a trifling article I took from him the night at
      the barracks. I thought it was the bank-notes I was getting; but it turned
      out better, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he produced a strong black leather pocket-book, fastened by a
      steel clasp. No sooner did Crofts behold it, than, with the spring of a
      tiger, he leaped forward and endeavored to clutch it. But Darby was on his
      guard, and immediately drew back his hand, calling out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, sir! I didn't keep it by me eight long years to give it up that
      way. There, my lords,&rdquo; said he, as he handed it to the bench, &ldquo;there's his
      pocket-book, with plenty of notes in it from many a one well known,&mdash;Maurice
      Mulcahy among the rest,&mdash;and you'll soon see who it was first tempted
      Fortescue to ruin, and who paid the money for doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A burst of horror and astonishment broke from the assembled crowd as Darby
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in a loud, determined tone, &ldquo;He is a perjurer!&rdquo; screamed Crofts. &ldquo;I
      repeat it, my lord; Fortescue is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix! and for a dead man he has a remarkable appetite,&rdquo; said Darby, &ldquo;and
      an elegant color in his face besides; for there he stands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he spoke, he pointed with his finger to a man who was leaning with
      folded arms against one of the pillars that supported the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every eye was now turned in the direction towards him; while the young
      barrister called out, &ldquo;Is your name Daniel Fortescue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before any answer could follow, several among the lawyers, who had
      known him in his college days, and felt attachment to him, had surrounded
      and recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Daniel Fortescue, my lord,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Whatever may be the
      consequences of the avowal, I say it here, before this court, that every
      statement the witness has made regarding me is true to the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A low, faint sound, heard throughout the stillness that followed these
      words, now echoed throughout the court; and Crofts had fallen, fainting,
      over the bench behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scene of tumultuous excitement now ensued, for while Crofts's friends,
      many of whom were present, assisted to carry him into the air, others
      pressed eagerly forward to catch a sight of Fortescue, who had already
      rivalled Darby himself in the estimation of the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall, powerfully-built man, of about thirty-five or thirty-six,
      dressed in the blue jacket and trousers of a sailor; but neither the
      habitude of his profession nor the humble dress he wore could conceal the
      striking evidence his air and bearing indicated of condition and birth. As
      he mounted the witness table,&mdash;for it was finally agreed that his
      testimony in disproof or corroboration of M'Keown should be heard,&mdash;a
      murmur of approbation went round, partly at the daring step he had thus
      ventured on taking, and partly excited by those personal gifts which are
      ever certain to have their effect upon any crowded assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not enter into the details of his evidence, which was given in a
      frank, straightforward manner, well suited to his appearance; never
      concealing for a moment the cause he had himself embarked in, nor assuming
      any favorable coloring for actions which ingenuity and the zeal of party
      would have found subjects for encomium rather than censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      His narrative not only confirmed all that Darby asserted, but also
      disclosed the atrocious scheme by which he had been first induced to join
      the ranks of the disaffected party. This was the work of Crofts, who knew
      and felt that Fortescue was the great barrier between himself and a large
      fortune. For this purpose Mulcahy was hired; to this end the whole long
      train of perfidy laid, which eventuated in his ruin: for so artfully had
      the plot been devised, each day's occurrence rendered retreat more
      difficult, until at last it became impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader is already aware of the catastrophe which concluded his career
      in the rebel army. It only remains now to be told that he escaped to
      America, where he entered as a sailor on board a merchantman; and although
      his superior acquirements and conduct might have easily bettered his
      fortune in his new walk in life, the dread of detection never left his
      mind, and he preferred the hardships before the mast to the vacillation of
      hope and fear a more conspicuous position would have exposed him to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vessel in which he served was wrecked off the coast of New Holland,
      and he and a few others of the crew were taken up by an English ship on
      her voyage outward. In a party sent on shore for water, Fortescue came up
      with Darby, who had made his escape from the convict settlement, and was
      wandering about the woods, almost dead of starvation, and scarcely covered
      with clothing. His pitiful condition, but perhaps more still, his native
      drollery, which even then was unextinguished, induced the sailors to yield
      to Fortescue's proposal, and they smuggled him on board in a water cask;
      and thus concealed, he made the entire voyage to England, where he landed
      about a fortnight before the trial. Fearful of being apprehended before
      the day, and determined at all hazards to give his evidence, he lay hid
      till the time we have already seen, when he suddenly came forward to my
      rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mulcahy, who worked in the same gang with Darby, or, to use the piper's
      grandiloquent expression,&mdash;for he burst out in this occasionally,&mdash;was
      &ldquo;in concatenated proximity to him,&rdquo; told the whole story of his own
      baseness, and loudly inveighed against Crofts for deserting him in his
      misfortunes. The pocket-book taken from Crofts by Darby amply corroborated
      this statement. It contained, besides various memoranda in the owner's
      handwriting, several letters from Mulcahy, detailing the progress of the
      conspiracy: some were in acknowledgment of considerable sums of money;
      others asking for supplies; but all confirmatory of the black scheme by
      which Fortescue's destruction was compassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might have been the sentiments of the crowded court regarding the
      former life and opinions of Fortescue and the piper, it was clear that now
      only one impression prevailed,&mdash;a general feeling of horror at the
      complicated villany of Crofts, whose whole existence had been one tissue
      of the basest treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The testimony was heard with attention throughout; no cross-examination
      was entered on; and the judge, briefly adverting to the case which was
      before the jury, and from whose immediate consideration subsequent events
      had in a great measure withdrawn their minds, directed them to deliver a
      verdict of &ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were re-echoed by the jury, who, man for man, exclaimed these
      words aloud, amid the most deafening cheers from every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I walked from the dock, fatigued, worn out, and exhausted, a dozen
      hands were stretched out to seize mine; but one powerful grasp caught my
      arm, and a well-known voice called in my ear,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' ye wor with Boney, Master Tom? Tare and 'ounds, didn't I know you'd
      be a great man yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant Fortescue came through the crowd towards me, with his
      hands outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should be friends, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for we both have suffered from a
      common enemy. If I am at liberty to leave this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not, sir,&rdquo; interposed a deep voice behind. We turned and beheld
      Major Barton. &ldquo;The massacre at Kil-macshogue has yet to be atoned for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortescue's face grew actually livid at the mention of the word, and his
      breathing became thick and short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; continued Barton, &ldquo;is the warrant for your committal. And you
      also, Darby,&rdquo; said he, turning round; &ldquo;we want your company once more in
      Newgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad, I suppose there's no use in sending an apology when friends is so
      pressing,&rdquo; said he, buttoning his coat as coolly as possible; &ldquo;but I hope
      you 'll let the master come in to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burke shall be admitted at all times,&rdquo; said Barton, with an
      obsequious civility I had never witnessed in him previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, maybe you 'll not be for letting him out so aisy,&rdquo; said Darby,
      dryly, for his notions of justice were tempered by a considerable dash of
      suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had only time left to press my purse into the honest fellow's hand, and
      salute Fortescue hastily, as they both were removed, under the custody of
      Barton. And I now made my way through the crowd into the hall, which
      opened a line for me as I went; a thousand welcomes meeting me from those
      who felt as anxious about the result of the trial as if a brother or a
      dear friend had been in peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      One face caught my eye as I passed; and partly from my own excitement,
      partly from its expression being so different from its habitual character,
      I could not recognize it as speedily as I ought to have done. Again and
      again it appeared; and at last, as I approached the door into the street,
      it was beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I might dare to express my congratulations,&rdquo; said a voice, weak from
      the tremulous anxiety of the speaker, and the shame which, real or
      affected, seemed to bow him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;Mr. Basset!&rdquo; for it was the worthy man himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Your father's old and confidential agent,&mdash;I might venture
      to say, friend,&mdash;come to see the son of his first patron occupy the
      station he has long merited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad memory is the only touch of age I remark in you, sir,&rdquo; said I,
      endeavoring to pass on, for I was unwilling at the moment of my escape
      from a great difficulty to lose temper with so unworthy an object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, sir, just a moment,&rdquo; said he, in a low whisper. &ldquo;You'll want
      money, probably. The November rents are not paid up; but there's a
      considerable balance to your credit. Will you take a hundred or two for
      the present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take money!&mdash;money from you!&rdquo; said I, shrinking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own, sir; your own estate. Do you forget,&rdquo; said he, with a miserable
      effort of a smile, &ldquo;that you are Mr. Burke of Cromore, with a clear rental
      of four thousand a year? We gained the Cluan Bog lawsuit, sir,&rdquo; continued
      he. &ldquo;'Twas I, sir, found the satisfaction for the bond. Your brother said
      he owed it all to Tony Basset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two last words were all that were needed to sum up the measure of my
      disgust and I once more tried to get forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the property, sir, for thirty-eight years I was over it. Your
      father and your brother always trusted me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me pass on, Mr. Basset,&rdquo; said I, calmly. &ldquo;I have no desire to become
      a greater object of mob curiosity. Pray let me pass on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for Darby M'Keown,&rdquo; whispered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of him?&rdquo; said I; for he had touched the most anxious chord of my
      heart at that instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have him free; he shall be at liberty in forty-eight hours for you.
      I have the whole papers by me; and a statement to the privy council will
      obtain his liberation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do this,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I 'll forgive more of your treatment of me than I
      could on any other plea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I call on you this evening, or to-morrow morning, at your hotel?
      Where do you stop, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening be it, if it hasten M'Keown's liberation. Remember, however,
      Mr. Basset, I'll hold no converse with you on any other subject till that
      be settled, and to my perfect satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bargain, sir,&rdquo; said he, with a grin of satisfaction; and dropping back,
      he suffered me to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the quays I went, and down Dame Street, accompanied by a great mob
      of people, who thought in my acquittal they had gained a triumph. For so
      it was; every case had its political feature, and seemed to be intimately
      connected with the objects of one party or the other. Partisan cheers,&mdash;the
      watchwords of faction,&mdash;were uttered as I went, and I was made to
      suffer that least satisfactory of all conditions, which bestows notoriety
      without fame, and popularity without merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I entered the hotel, I recognized many of the persons I had seen there
      before; but their looks were no longer thrown towards me with the
      impertinence they then assumed. On the contrary, a studied desire to
      evince courtesy and politeness was evident. &ldquo;How strange is it!&rdquo; thought
      I; &ldquo;how differently does the whole world smile to the rich man and to the
      poor!&rdquo; Here were many who could in nowise derive advantage from my altered
      condition,&mdash;as perfectly independent of me as I of them; and yet even
      they showed that degree of deference in their manner which the expectant
      bestows upon a patron. So it is, however. The position which wealth
      confers is recognized by all; the individual who fills it is but an
      attribute of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life had, indeed, opened on me with a new and very different aspect; and I
      felt, as I indulged in the daydreams which the sudden possession of
      fortune excites, that to enjoy thoroughly the blessings of independence,
      one must have experienced, as I had, the hard pressure of adversity. It
      seemed to me that the long road of gloomy fate had at length reached its
      turning point, and that I should now travel along a calmer and happier
      path. Thoughts of the new career that lay before me were blended with the
      memories of the past; hopes they were, but dashed with the shadows which a
      blighted affection will throw over the whole stream of life. Still that
      evening was one of happiness; not of that excited pleasure derived from
      the attainment of a long coveted object, but the calmer enjoyment felt in
      the safety of the haven by him who has experienced the hurricane and the
      storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such thoughts I went to rest, and laid my head on my pillow in
      thoughtfulness and peace. In my dreams my troubles still lingered. But who
      regrets the anxious minutes of a vision which wakening thoughts dispel?
      Are they not rather the mountain shadows that serve to brighten the gleam
      of the sunlight in the plain?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thus the morning broke for me, with all the ecstasy of danger
      passed, and all the crowding hopes of a happy future. The hundred
      speculations which in poverty I had formed for the comfort of the poor and
      the humble might now be realized; and I fancied myself the centre of a
      happy peasantry, confiding and contented. It would be hard, indeed, to
      forget &ldquo;the camp and the tented field&rdquo; in the peaceful paths of a country
      life. But simple duties are often as engrossing as those of a higher
      order, and bring a reward not less grateful to the heart; and I flattered
      myself to think my ambition reached not above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moments in which such daydreams are indulged are the very happiest of
      a lifetime. The hopes which are based on the benefits we may render to
      others are sources of elevation to ourselves; and such motives purify the
      soul, and exalt the mind to a pitch far above the petty ambitions of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      To myself, and to my own enjoyments, wealth could contribute less than to
      most men. The simple habits of a soldier's life satisfied every wish of my
      mind. The luxuries which custom makes necessary to others I never knew;
      and I formed my resolution not to wander from this path of humble,
      inexpensive tastes, so that the stream of charity might flow the wider.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were my waking thoughts. Alas, how little do we ever realize of such
      speculations! and how few glide down the stream of life unswayed by the
      eddies and crosscurrents of fortune! The higher we build the temple of our
      hopes, the more surely will it topple to its fall. Who shall say that our
      greatest enjoyment is not in raising the pile, and our happiest hours the
      full abandonment to those hopes our calmer reason never ratified?
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet it had not occurred to me to think what position the world might
      concede to one whose life had been passed like mine, nor did I bestow a
      care upon a matter whereon so much of future happiness depended. These,
      however, were considerations which could not be long averted. How they
      came, and in what manner they were met must remain for a future chapter of
      my history.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. HASTY RESOLUTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      In my last chapter I brought my reader to that portion of my story which
      formed the turning-point of my destiny. And here I might, perhaps,
      conclude these brief memoirs of an early life, whose chief object was to
      point out the results of a hasty and rash judgment, which, formed in mere
      boyhood, exerted its influence throughout the entire of a lifetime. Only
      one incident remains still to be told; and I shall not trespass on the
      good-natured patience of my readers by any delay in the narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      From being poor, houseless, and unknown, a sudden turn of fortune had made
      me wealthy and conspicuous in station; the owner of a large estate,&mdash;almost
      a lead-ing man in my native county. My influence was sufficient to procure
      the liberation of M'Keown; and my interference in his behalf mainly
      contributed to procure for Fortescue the royal pardon. The world, as the
      phrase is, went with me; and the good luck which attended every step I
      took and every plan I engaged in was become a proverb among my neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let not any one suppose I was unmindful or ungrateful, if I confess, that
      even with all these I was not happy. No: the tranquil mind, the spirit at
      ease with itself, cannot exist where the sense of duty is not. The impulse
      which swayed my boyish heart still moved the ambition of the man. The
      pursuits I should have deemed the noblest and the purest seemed to me
      uninteresting and ignoble; the associations I ought to have felt the
      happiest and the highest appeared to me vulgar, and low, and commonplace.
      I was disappointed in my early dream of liberty, and had found tyranny
      where I looked for freedom, and intolerance where I expected
      enlightenment; but if so, I recurred with tenfold enthusiasm to the career
      of the soldier, whose glories were ever before me. That noble path had not
      deceived me; far from it. Its wild and whirlwind excitement, its hazardous
      enterprise, its ever-present dangers, were stimulants I loved and gloried
      in. All the chances and changes of a peaceful life were poor and mean
      compared to the hourly vicissitudes of war. I knew not then, it is true,
      how much of enjoyment I derived from forgetful ness; how many of my
      springs of happiness flowed from that preoccupation which prevented my
      dwelling on the only passion that ever stirred my heart,&mdash;my love for
      one whose love was hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      How thoroughly will the character of an early love tinge the whole of a
      life! Our affections are like flowers,&mdash;they derive their sweetness
      and their bloom from the soil in which they grow: some, budding in joy and
      gladness, amid the tinkling plash of a glittering fountain, live on ever
      bright and beautiful; others, struggling on amid thorns and wild weeds,
      overshadowed by gloom, preserve their early impressions to the last,&mdash;their
      very sweetness tells of sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To conquer the memory of this hopeless passion, I tried a hundred ways. I
      endeavored, by giving myself up to the duties of a country gentleman, to
      become absorbed in all the cares and pursuits which had such interest for
      my neighbors. Failing in this, I became a sportsman; I kept horses and
      dogs, and entered, with all the zest mere determination can impart, upon
      that life of manly exertion, so full of pleasure to thousands. But here
      again without succeeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into society; but soon retired from it, on finding, that among the
      class of my equals the prestige of my early life had still tracked me. I
      was in their eyes a rebel, whose better fortune had saved him from the
      fate of his companions. My youth had given no guarantee for my manhood;
      and I was not trusted. Baffled in every endeavor to obliterate my secret
      grief, I recurred to it now, as though privileged by fate, to indulge a
      memory nothing could efface. I abandoned all the petty appliances by which
      I sought to shut out the past, and gave myself up in full abandonment to
      the luxury of my melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living entirely within the walls of my demesne, never seen by my
      neighbors, not making nor receiving visits, I appeared to many a heartless
      recluse, whose misanthropy sought indulgence in solitude; others, less
      harshly, judged me as one whose unhappy entrance on life had unfitted him
      for the station to which fortune had elevated him. By both I was soon
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasantry were less ungenerous, and more just. They saw in me one who
      felt acutely for the privations they were suffering; yet never gave them
      that cheap, delusive hope, that legislative changes will touch social
      evils,&mdash;that the acts of a parliament will penetrate the thousand
      tortuous windings of a poor man's destiny. They found in me a friend and
      an adviser. They only-wondered at one thing,&mdash;how any man could feel
      for the poor, and not hate the rich. So long had the struggle lasted
      between affluence and misery, they could not understand a compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitter as their poverty had been, it never extinguished the poetry of
      their lives. They were hungry and naked; but they held to their ancient
      traditions, and they built on them great hopes for the future. The old
      family names, the time-honored memories of place, the famous deeds of
      ancestors, made an ideal existence powerful enough to exclude the pressure
      of actual daily evils; and they argued from what had been to what might
      be, with a persistency of hope it seemed almost cruel to destroy. So
      deeply were these thoughts engrained into their natures, they felt him but
      half their friend who ventured to despise them. The relief of present
      poverty, the succor of actual suffering, became in their eyes an effort of
      mere passing kindness. They looked to some great amelioration of
      condition, some wondrous change, some restoration to an imaginary standard
      of independence and comfort, which all the efforts of common interference
      fell sadly short of; and thus they strained their gaze to a government, a
      ruling power, for a boon undefined, unknown, and illimitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      To expectations like these advice and slight assistance are as the mere
      drop of water to the parched tongue of thirst; and so I found it. I could
      neither encourage them in their hopes of such legislative changes as would
      greatly ameliorate their condition, nor flatter them in the delusion that
      none of their misfortunes were of home origin; and thus, if they felt
      gratitude for many kindnesses, they reposed no confidence in my opinion.
      The trading patriot, who promised much while he pocketed their hard-earned
      savings; the rabid newspaper writer, who libelled the Government and
      denounced the landlord,&mdash;were their standards of sympathy; and he who
      fell short of either was not their friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, the social state of the people was rotten to its very core.
      Their highest qualities, degraded by the combined force of poverty,
      misrule, and superstition, had become sources of crime and misery. They
      had suffered so long and so much, their patience was exhausted; and they
      preferred the prospect of any violent convulsion which might change the
      face of the land, whatever dangers it might come with, to a slow and
      gradual improvement of condition, however safe and certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      To win their confidence at the only price they would accord it, I never
      could consent to; and without it I was almost powerless for good. Here
      again, therefore, did I find closed against me another avenue for
      exertion; and the only one of all I could have felt a fitting sphere for
      my labor. The violence of their own passionate natures, the headlong
      impulses by which they suffered themselves to be swayed, left them no
      power of judgment regarding those whose views were more moderate and
      temperate. They could understand the high Tory landlord, whom they
      invested with every attribute of tyranny, as their open, candid opponent;
      they could see a warm friend in the violent mob-orator of the day; but
      they recognized no trait of kindness in him who would rather see them fed
      than flattered, and behold them in the enjoyment of comfort sooner than in
      the ecstasy of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      From &ldquo;Darby the Blast&rdquo;&mdash;for he was now a member of my household&mdash;I
      learned the light in which I was regarded by the people, and heard the
      dissatisfaction they expressed that one who &ldquo;sarved Boney&rdquo; should not be
      ready to head a rising, if need be. Thus was I in a false position on
      every side. Mistrusted by all, because I would neither enter into the
      exaggerations of party, nor become blind to the truth my senses revealed
      before me, my sphere of utility was narrowed to the discharge of the mere
      duties of common charity and benevolence, and my presence among my
      tenantry no more productive of benefit than if I had left my purse as my
      representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years rolled on, and in the noiseless track of time I forgot its flight. I
      now had grown so wedded to the habits of my solitary life, that its very
      monotony was a source of pleasure. I had intrenched myself within a little
      circle of enjoyments, and among my books and in my walks my days went
      pleasantly over.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time, I did not dare to read the daily papers, nor learn the
      great events which agitated Europe. I tried to think that an interval of
      repose would leave me indifferent to their mention; and so rigidly did I
      abstain from indulging my curiosity, that the burning of Moscow, and the
      commencement of the dreadful retreat which followed, was the first fact I
      read of.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment I gave way, the passion for intelligence from France
      became a perfect mania. Where were the different corps of the &ldquo;Grand
      Army&rdquo;? where the Emperor himself? by what great stroke of genius would he
      emerge from the difficulties around him, and deal one of his fatal blows
      on the enemy?&mdash;were the questions which met me as I awoke, and
      tortured me during the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each movement of that terrible retreat I followed in the gazettes with an
      anxiety verging on insanity. I tracked the long journey on the map, and as
      I counted towns and villages, dreary deserts of snow, and vast rivers to
      be traversed, my heart grew faint to think how many a brave soldier would
      never reach that fair France for whose glory he had shed his best blood.
      Disaster followed disaster; and as the news reached England, came accounts
      of those great defections which weakened the force of the &ldquo;Grand Army,&rdquo;
       and deranged the places formed for its retiring movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      They who can recall to mind the time I speak of, will remember the effect
      produced in England by the daily accounts from the seat of war; how
      heavily fell the blows of that altered fortune which once rested on the
      eagles of France; how each new bulletin announced another feature of
      misfortune,&mdash;some shattered remnant of a great <i>corps d'armée</i>
      cut off by Cossacks,&mdash;some dreadful battle engaged against superior
      numbers, and fought with desperation, not for victory, but the liberty to
      retreat. Great names were mentioned among the slain, and the proudest
      chivalry of Gaul left to perish on the far-off steppes of Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the fearful tales men read of that terrible campaign; and the
      joy in England was great, to hear that the most powerful of her enemies
      had at length experienced the full bitterness of defeat. While men vied
      with one another in stories of the misfortunes of the Emperor,&mdash;when
      each post added another to the long catalogue of disasters to the &ldquo;Grand
      Army,&rdquo;&mdash;I sat in my lonely house, in a remote part of Ireland,
      brooding over the sad reverses of him who still formed my ideal of a hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought how, amid the crumbling ruins of his splendid force, his great
      soul would survive the crash that made all others despair; that each new
      evil would suggest its remedy as it arose, and the mind that never failed
      in expedient would shine out more brilliantly through the gloom of
      darkening fortune than even it had done in the noonday splendor of
      success. When all others could only see the tremendous energy of despair,
      I thought I could recognize those glorious outbursts of heroism by which a
      French army sought and won the favor of their Emperor. The routed and
      straggling bodies which hurried along in seeming disorder, I gloried to
      perceive could assume all the port and bearing of soldiers at the approach
      of danger, and form their ranks at the wild &ldquo;houra&rdquo; of the Cossack as
      steadily as in the proudest day of their prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The retreat continued: the horrible suffering of a Russian winter added to
      the carnage of a battle-tide, which flowed unceasingly from the ruined
      walls of the Kremlin to the banks of the Vistula: the battle of Borisow
      and the passage of the Berezina followed fast on each other. And now we
      heard that the Emperor had surrendered the chief command to Murat, and was
      hastening back to France with lightning speed; for already the day of his
      evil fortune had thrown its shadow over the capital. No longer reckoned by
      tens of thousands, that vast army had now dwindled down to divisions of a
      few hundred men. The Old Guard scarce exceeded one thousand; and of twenty
      entire regiments of cavalry, Murat mustered a single squadron as a
      bodyguard. Crowds of wounded and mutilated men dragged their weary limbs
      along over the hardened snow, or through dense pine forests where no
      villages were to be met with,&mdash;a fatuous determination to strive to
      reach France, the only impulse surviving amid all their sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the defections of D'York and Massenbach, then began that new feature
      of disaster which was so soon to burst forth with all the fell fury of
      long pent-up hatred. The nationality of Germany&mdash;so long, so cruelly
      insulted&mdash;now saw the day of retribution arrive. Misfortune hastened
      misfortune, and defeat engendered treason in the ranks of the Emperor's
      allies. Murat, too, the favorite of Napoleon, the king of his creation,
      deserted him now, and fled ignominiously from the command of the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Elbe! the Elbe!&rdquo; was now the cry amid the shattered ranks of that
      army which but a year before saw no limit to its glorious path. The Elbe
      was the only line remaining which promised a moment's repose from the
      fatigues and privations of months long. Along that road the army could
      halt, and stem the tide of pursuit, however hotly it pressed. The
      Prussians had already united with the Russians; the defection of Austria
      could not be long distant; Saxony was appealed to, as a member of the
      German family, to join in arms against the Tyrant; and the wild &ldquo;houra&rdquo; of
      the Cossack now blended with the loud &ldquo;Vorwarts&rdquo; of injured Prussia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall he seek succor now? What remains to him in this last eventful
      struggle? How shall the Emperor call back to life the legions by whose
      valor his great victories were gained, and Europe made a vassal at the
      foot of his throne?&rdquo; Such was the thought that never left me day or night.
      Ever present before me was his calm brow, and his face paler, but not less
      handsome, than its wont. I could recall his rapid glance; the quick and
      hurried motion of his hand; his short and thick utterance, as words of
      command fell from his lips; and his smile, as he heard some intelligence
      with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not sleep,&mdash;scarcely could I eat. A feverish excitement
      burned through my frame, and my parched tongue and hot hand told how the
      very springs of health were dried up within me. I walked with hurried
      steps from place to place; now muttering the words of some despatch, now
      fancying that I was sent with orders for a movement of troops. As I rode,
      I spurred my horse to a gallop, and in my heated imagination believed I
      was in presence of the enemy, and preparing for the fray. Great as my
      exhaustion frequently was, weariness brought no rest. Often I returned
      home at evening, overcome by fatigue; but a sleepless night, tortured with
      anxieties and harassed with doubts and fears, followed, and I awoke to
      pursue the same path, till in my weakened frame and hectic cheek the signs
      of illness could no longer be mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terrified at the ravages a few weeks had made in my health, and fearful
      what secret malady was preying upon me, Darby, without asking any leave
      from me, left the house one morning at daybreak, and returned with the
      physician of the neighboring town. I was about to mount my horse, when I
      saw them coming up the avenue, and immediately guessed the object of the
      visit. A moment was enough to decide me as to the course to pursue; for
      well knowing how disposed the world ever is to stamp the impress of
      wandering intellect on any habit of mere eccentricity, I resolved to
      receive the doctor as though I was glad of his coming, and consult with
      him regarding my state. This would at least refute such a scandal, by
      enlisting the physician among the allies of my cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      By good fortune, Dr. Clibborn was a man of shrewd common sense, as well as
      a physician of no mean skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the brief conversation we held together, I perceived, that while he
      paid all requisite attention to any detail which implied the existence of
      malady, his questions were more pointedly directed to the possibility of
      some mental cause of irritation,&mdash;the source of my ailment. I could
      see, however, that his opinion inclined to the belief that the events of
      the trial had left their indelible traces on my mind; which, inducing me
      to adopt a life of isolation and retirement, had now produced the effects
      he witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not sorry at this mistake on his part. By suffering him to indulge
      in this delusive impression, I saved myself all the trouble of concealing
      my real feelings, which I had no desire to expose before him. I permitted
      him, therefore, to reason with me on the groundless notions he supposed I
      had conceived of the world's feeling regarding me, and heard him patiently
      as he detailed the course of public duty, by fulfilling which I should
      occupy my fitting place in society, and best consult my own health and
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;certain fixed impressions, which I would not so
      combat. It was but yesterday, for instance, I yielded to the wish of an
      old general officer, who has served upwards of half a century, and desires
      once more to put himself at the head of his regiment. His heart was bent
      on it. I saw that though he might consent to abandon his purpose, I was
      not so sure his mind might bear the disappointment; for the intellect will
      sometimes go astray in endeavoring to retrace its steps. So I thought it
      better to concede what might cost more in the refusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words of the doctor remained in my head long after he took his
      leave, and I could not avoid applying them to my own case. Was not <i>my</i>
      impression of this nature? Were not <i>my</i> thoughts all centred on one
      theme as fixedly as the officer's of whom he spoke? Could I, by any effort
      of my reason or my will, control my wandering fancies, and call them back
      to the dull realities amongst which I lived?
    </p>
    <p>
      These were ever recurring to me, and always with the same reply. It is in
      vain to struggle against an impulse which has swallowed up all other
      ambitions. My heart is among the glittering ranks and neighing squadrons
      of France; I would be there once more; I would follow that career which
      first stirred the proudest hopes I ever cherished.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening the mail brought the news that Eugène Beauharnais had
      fallen back on Magdeburg, and sent repeated despatches to the Emperor,
      entreating his immediate presence among the troops, whom nothing but
      Napoleon himself in the midst of them could restore to their wonted
      bravery and determination. The reply of Napoleon was briefly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming; and all who love me, follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How the words rang in my ears,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Tous ceux qui m'aiment!</i>&rdquo; I
      heard them in every rustling of the wind and motion of the leaves against
      the window; they were whispered to my sense by every avenue of my brain;
      and I sat no longer occupied in reading as usual, but with folded arms,
      repeating word by word the brief sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight. All was still and silent through the house; no servant
      stirred, and the very wind was hushed to a perfect calm. I was sitting in
      my library, when the words I have repeated seemed spoken in a low, clear
      voice beside me. I started up: the perspiration broke over my forehead and
      fell upon my cheek with terror; for I knew I was alone, and the fearful
      thought flashed on me,&mdash;this may be madness! For a second or two the
      agony of the idea was almost insupportable. Then came a resolve as sudden.
      I opened my desk, and took from it all the ready money I possessed; I
      wrote a few hurried lines to my agent; and then, making my way noiselessly
      to the stable, I saddled my horse and led him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two hours I was nearly twenty miles on my way to Dublin. Day was
      breaking as I entered the capital. I made no delay there; but taking fresh
      horses, started for Skerries, where I knew the fishermen of the coast
      resorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred pounds to the man who will land me on the coast of France or
      Holland,&rdquo; said I to a group that were preparing their nets on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of incredulity was the only reply. A very few words, however,
      settled the bargain. Ere half an hour I was on board. The wind freshened,
      and we stood out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the breeze keep to this,&rdquo; said the skipper, &ldquo;and we'll make the
      voyage quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both wind and tide were in our favor. We held down Channel rapidly; and I
      saw the blue hills grow fainter and fainter, till the eye could but detect
      a gray cloud on the horizon, which at last disappeared in the bright sun
      of noon, and a wide waste of blue water lay on every side.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. THE LAST CAMPAIGN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The snow, half melted with the heavy rains, lay still deeply on the roads,
      and a dark, lowering sky stretched above, as I harried onwards, with all
      the speed I could, towards the east of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the Allies had passed the Rhine. Schwartzen-berg in the south,
      Blucher in the east, and Bernadotte on the Flemish frontier, were
      conveying their vast armies to bear down on him whom singly none had dared
      to encounter. All France was in arms, and every step was turned eastwards.
      Immense troops of conscripts, many scarce of the age of boyhood, crowded
      the highways. The veterans themselves were enrolled once more, and formed
      battalions for the defence of their native land. Every town and village
      was a garrison. The deep-toned rolling of ammunition wagons and the heavy
      tramp of horses sounded through the nights long. War, terrible war, spoke
      from every object around. Strongholds were strengthening, regiments
      brigading, cavalry organizing on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      No longer, however, did I witness the wild enthusiasm which I so well
      remembered among the soldiers of the army. Here were no glorious outbreaks
      of that daring spirit which so marked the Frenchman, and made him almost
      irresistible in arms. A sad and gloomy silence prevailed: a look of fierce
      but hopeless determination was over all. They marched like men going to
      death, but with the step and bearing of heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entered the little town of Verviers. The day was breaking, but the
      troops were under arms. The Emperor had but just taken his departure for
      Châlons-sur-Marne. They told me of it as I changed horses,&mdash;not with
      that fierce pride which a mere passing glance at the great Napoleon would
      once have evoked; they spoke of him without emotion. I asked if he were
      paler or thinner than his wont: they did not know. They said that he
      travelled post, but that his staff were on horseback. From this I gathered
      that he was either ill, or in that frame of mind in which he preferred to
      be alone. While I was yet speaking, an officer of Engineers came up to the
      carriage, and called out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unharness these horses, and bring them down to the barracks. These, sir,&rdquo;
       said he, turning towards me, &ldquo;are not times to admit of ceremony. We have
      eighteen guns to move, and want cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, sir,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am not here to retard your movements, but if I
      can, to forward them. Can I, as a volunteer, be of any service at this
      moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you served before? Of course you have, though. In what arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a Hussar of the Guard, for some years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along with me; I 'll bring you to the general at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Re-entering the inn, the officer preceded me up stairs, and after a
      moment's delay, introduced me into the presence of General Letort, then
      commanding a cavalry brigade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard your request, sir. Where is your commission? Have you got it
      with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I handed it to him in silence. He examined it rapidly; and then turning
      the reverse, read the few lines inscribed by the minister of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have given you a post this day, sir, this very hour,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;but for a blunder of our commissariat people. There's a troop here
      waiting for a re-mount, but the order has not come down from Paris; and
      our officials here will not advance the money till it arrives, as if these
      were times for such punctilio. They are to form part of General
      Kellermann's force, which is sadly deficient. Remain here, however, and
      perhaps by to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much may the sum be, sir?&rdquo; asked I, interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general almost started with surprise at the abruptness of my question,
      and in a tone of half reproof answered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The amount required is beside the matter, sir; unless,&rdquo; added he,
      sarcastically, &ldquo;you are disposed to advance it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such was the object of my question,&rdquo; said I, calmly, and determining not
      to notice the manner he had assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed he, &ldquo;that is very different. Twenty thousand
      francs, however, is a considerable sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have as much, and something more, if need be, in my carriage,&mdash;if
      English gold be no objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>pardie!</i> that it is not,&rdquo; cried he, laughing; &ldquo;I only wish we
      saw more of it. Are you serious in all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The best reply to his question was to hasten down stairs and return with
      two small canvas bags in my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are one thousand guineas,&rdquo; said I, laying them on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      While one of the general's aides-de-camp was counting and examining the
      gold, I repeated at his request the circumstances which brought me once
      again to France to serve under the banner of the Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your name, sir,&rdquo; said he, as he seated himself to write, &ldquo;is Thomas
      Burke, ci-devant captain of the Eighth Hussars of the Guard. Well, I can
      promise you the restoration of your old grade. Meanwhile, you must take
      command of these fellows. They are mere partisan troops, hurriedly raised,
      and ill organized; but I'll give you a letter to General Damrémont at
      Chalons, and he 'll attend to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a position for myself I seek, General,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Wherever I can
      best serve the Emperor, there only I desire to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have ventured to leave that point to General Damrémont,&rdquo; said he,
      smiling. &ldquo;Your motives do not require much explanation. Let us to
      breakfast now, and by noon we shall have everything in readiness for your
      departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus rapidly, and as it were by the merest accident, was I again become a
      soldier of the Emperor; and that same day was once more at the head of a
      squadron, on my way to Châlons. My troop were, indeed, very unlike the
      splendid array of my old Hussars of the Guard. They were hurriedly raised,
      and not over well equipped, but still they were stout-looking, hardy
      peasants, who, whatever deficiency of drill they might display, I knew
      well would exhibit no lack of courage before an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Châlons, I found that General Damrémont had left with the
      staff for Vitry only a few hours before; and so I reported myself to the
      officer commanding the town, and was ordered by him to join the cavalry
      brigade then advancing on Vitry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I time at this moment, I could not help devoting some minutes to an
      account of that strange and motley mass which then were brigaded as
      Imperial cavalry. Dragoons of every class, heavy and light-armed,&mdash;grenadiers
      à cheval and hussars, cuirassiers, carbineers, and lancers,&mdash;were
      all, pell-mell, mixed up confusedly together, and hurried onwards; some to
      join their respective corps if they could find them, but all prepared to
      serve wherever their sabres might be called for. It was confusion to the
      last degree; but a tumult without enthusiasm or impulse. The superior
      officers, who were well acquainted with the state of events, made no
      secret of their gloomy forebodings; the juniors lacked energy in a cause
      where they saw no field for advancement; and the soldiers, always prepared
      to imbibe their feelings from their officers, seemed alike sad and
      dispirited.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a change was this from the wild and joyous spirit which once animated
      every grade and class,&mdash;from the generous enthusiasm that once warmed
      each bold heart, and made every soldier a hero! Alas! the terrible
      consequences of long defeat were on all. The tide of battle that rolled
      disastrously from the ruined walls of the Kremlin still swept along
      towards the great Palace of the Tuileries. Germany had witnessed the
      destruction of two mighty armies; the third and last was now awaiting the
      eventful struggle on the very soil of their country. The tide of
      fugitives, which preceded the retiring columns of Victor and Ney, met the
      advancing bodies of the conscripts, and spread dismay and consternation as
      they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dejection was but the shadow of the last approaching disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the 27th January, the cavalry brigade with which I was
      received orders to march by the Forest of Bar on Brienne, where Blücher
      was stationed in no expectation of being attacked. The movement,
      notwithstanding the heavy roads, was made with great rapidity; and by noon
      on the following day we came up with the main body of the army in full
      march against the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then once more did I recognize the old spirit of the army. Joyous songs
      and gay cheers were heard from the different corps we passed. The
      announcement of a speedy meeting with the Prussians had infused new vigor
      among the troops. We were emerging from the deep shade of the wood into a
      valley, where a light infantry regiment were bivouacked. Their fires were
      formed in a wide circle, and the cooking went merrily on, amid the
      pleasant song and jocund cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our own brief halt was just concluded, when the bugles sounded to resume
      the march; and I stood for a moment admiring the merry gambols of the
      infantry, when an air I well remembered was chanted forth in full chorus.
      But my memory was not left long in doubt as to where and how these sounds
      were first heard. The wild uproar at once recalled both, as they sang out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah for the Faubourg of St. Antoine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner did I hear the words, than I spurred my horse forward and rode
      down towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What regiment's yours, Comrade?&rdquo; said I, to a fellow hurrying to the
      ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fifth, mon officier,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Voltigeurs of the Line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a certain François, a maître d'armes, still among you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that we have. There he is yonder, beating time to the roulade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked in the direction he pointed, and there stood my old friend. He
      was advanced in front of a company, and with the air of a tambour-major he
      seemed as if he was giving time to the melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>sacré</i> conscripts that ye are!&rdquo; cried he, as with his fist
      clenched he gesticulated fiercely towards them; &ldquo;can't ye keep the
      measure? Once, now, and all together:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Picardy first, and then&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo, Maître François! can you remember an old friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man turned suddenly, and bringing his hand to the salute,
      remained stiff and erect, as if on parade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connais pas, mon capitaine,&rdquo; was his answer, after a considerable pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! not know me!&mdash;me, whom you made one of your own gallant
      company, calling me 'Burke of Ours'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>par la barbe de Saint Pierre!</i> is this my dear comrade of the
      Eighth? Why, where have you been? They said you left us forever and aye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried it, François; but it wouldn't do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mille bombes!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but you 're back in pleasant times,&mdash;to see
      the Cossacks learning to drink champagne, and leave us to pay the score.
      Come along, however; take your old place here. You are free to choose now,
      and needn't be a dragoon any longer; not but that your old general will be
      glad to see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General d'Auvergne! Where is he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the light cavalry brigade, in front; I saw him pass here two hours
      since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how looks he, François?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little stooped, or so, more than you knew him; but his seat in the
      saddle seems just as firm. <i>Ventrebleu!</i> if he 'd been a voltigeur,
      he 'd be a good man these ten years to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delighted to learn that I was so near my dearest and oldest friend in the
      world, I shook Francois's hand, and parted; but not without a pledge, that
      whenever I joined the infantry, the Fifth Voltigeurs of the Line were to
      have the preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we advanced towards Brienne the distant thunder of large guns was
      heard; which gradually grew louder and more sustained, and betokened that
      the battle had already begun. The roads, blocked up with dense masses of
      infantry and long trains of wagons, prevented our rapid advance; and when
      we tried the fields at either side, the soil, cut up with recent rains,
      made us sink to the very girths of our horses. Still, order after order
      came for the troops to press forward, and every effort was made to obey
      the command.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was five o'clock as we debouched into the plain, and beheld the fields
      whereon the battle had been contested; for already the enemy were
      retiring, and the French troops in eager pursuit. Behind, however, lay the
      town of Brienne, still held by the Russians, but now little better than a
      heap of smoking ruins, the tremendous fire of the French artillery having
      reduced the place to ashes. Conspicuous above all rose the dismantled
      walls of the ancient military college; the school where Napoleon had
      learned his first lesson in war, where first he essayed to point those
      guns which now with such fearful havoc he turned against itself. What a
      strange, sad Subject of contemplation for him who now gazed on it! On
      either side, the fire of the artillery continued till nightfall; but the
      Russians still held the town. A few straggling shots closed the combat;
      and darkness now spread over the wide plain, save where the watchfires
      marked out the position of the French troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flash of lurid flame, however, threw its gleam over the town, and
      a wild cheer was heard rising above the clatter of musketry. It was a
      surprise party of grenadiers, who had forced their way into the grounds of
      the old château, where Blücher held his headquarters. Louder and louder
      grew the firing, and a red glare in the dark sky told how the battle was
      raging. Up that steep street, at the top of which the venerable château
      stood, poured the infantry columns in a run. The struggle was short. The
      dull sound of the Russian drum soon proclaimed a retreat; and a rocket
      darting through the black sky announced to the Emperor that the position
      had been won.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the Emperor fixed his headquarters at the château, and a
      battalion of the guard bivouacked in the park around it. I had sent
      forward the letter to Général Damrémont, and was wondering when and in
      what terms the reply might come, when the general himself rode up,
      accompanied by a single aide-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had the opportunity, sir, to speak of your conduct in the proper
      quarter,&rdquo; said he, courteously; &ldquo;and the result is, your appointment as
      major of the Tenth Hussars, or, if you prefer it, the staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever, sir, my humble services can best be employed. I have no other
      wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take the regimental rank,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;your brigade will see enough of
      hot work ere long. And now push forward to Mézières, where you'll find
      your regiment. They have received orders to march to-morrow, early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was not sorry to be relieved from the command of my irregular horse, who
      went by the title of &ldquo;brigands&rdquo; in the army generally; though, if the
      truth were to be told, the reproach on the score of honesty came ill from
      those who conferred it. Still, it was a more gratifying position to hold a
      rank in a regiment of regular cavalry, and one whose reputation was second
      to none in the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to present myself to the colonel in command, sir,&rdquo; said I,
      addressing an officer, who with two or three others stood chatting at the
      door of a cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 'll find him here, sir,&rdquo; said he, pointing to the hut. But, as he
      spoke, the clank of a sabre was heard, and at the same instant a tall,
      soldierlike figure stooped beneath the low doorway, and came forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The colonel of the Tenth, I presume?&rdquo; said I, handing the despatch from
      General Damrémont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! my old college friend and companion!&rdquo; cried the colonel, as he
      stepped back in amazement. &ldquo;Have I such good fortune as to see you in my
      regiment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be really so?&rdquo; said I, in equal astonishment. &ldquo;Are you Tascher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear friend; the same Tascher you used to disarm so easily at
      college,&mdash;a colonel at last. But why are you not at the head of a
      regiment long since? Oh! I forgot, though,&rdquo; said he, in some confusion; &ldquo;I
      heard all about it. But come in here; I've no better quarters to offer
      you, but such as it is, make it yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My old companion of the Polytechnique was, indeed, little altered by time,&mdash;careless,
      inconsiderate, and good-hearted as ever. He told me that he had only
      gained the command of the regiment a few weeks before; &ldquo;and,&rdquo; added he,
      &ldquo;if matters mend not soon, I am scarcely like to hold it much longer. The
      despatches just received tell that the Allies are concentrating at
      Trannes; and if so, we shall have a battle against overwhelming odds. No
      matter, Burke; you have got into a famous corps,&mdash;they fight
      splendidly, and my excellent uncle, his Majesty, loves to indulge their
      predilection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I passed the day with Tascher, chatting over our respective fortunes; and
      in discussing the past and the future the greater part of the night went
      over. Before dawn, however, we were on the march towards Chaumière,
      whither the army was directed, and the Emperor himself then stationed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 1st of February, and the weather was dark, lowering, and
      gloomy. A cold wind drove the snowdrift in fitful gusts before it, and the
      deep roads made our progress slow and difficult. As our line of advance,
      however, was not that by which the other divisions were marching, it was
      already past noon before we knew that the enemy was but three leagues
      distant. On advancing farther, we heard the faint sounds of a cannonade;
      and then they grew louder and louder, till the whole air seemed tremulous
      with the concussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A heavy fire, Colonel,&rdquo; said a veteran officer of the regiment. &ldquo;I should
      guess there are not less than eighty or a hundred guns engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Press on, men! press on!&rdquo; cried Tascher. &ldquo;When his Majesty provides such
      music, it's scarcely polite to be late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a quick trot we came on, and about three o'clock debouched in the plain
      behind Oudinot's battalions of reserve, which were formed in two dense
      columns, about a hundred yards apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hussars to the front!&rdquo; cried an aide-de-camp, as he galloped past, and
      waved his cap in the direction of the space between the columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      In separate squadrons we penetrated through the defile, and came out on an
      open plain behind the centre of the first line. The ground was
      sufficiently elevated here, so that I could overlook the front line; but
      all I could see was a dense, heavy smoke, which intervened between the two
      positions, in the midst of which, and directly in front, a village lay.
      Towards this, three columns of infantry were converging, and around the
      sounds of battle were raging. This was La Giberie: the hamlet formed the
      key of the French position, and had been twice carried by, and twice
      regained from, the Allies. As I looked, the supporting columns halted,
      wheeled, and retired; while a tremendous shower of grape was poured upon
      them from the village, which now seemed to have been retaken by the
      Allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cavalry to the front!&rdquo; was now the order; and a force of six thousand
      sabres advanced from between the battalions, and formed for attack. It was
      Nansouty who led them, and his heavy cuirassiers were in the van; and then
      came the grenadiers à cheval; ours was the third, in column. As each
      regiment debouched, the word &ldquo;Charge!&rdquo; rang out, and forward we went. The
      snow drifting straight against us, we could see nothing; nor was I
      conscious of any check to our course till the shaking of the vast column
      in front and then the opening of the squadrons denoted resistance, when
      suddenly a flash flared out, and a hurricane of cannon-shot tore through
      our dense files. Then I knew that we were attacking a battery of guns,&mdash;and
      not till then. Mad cheers and cries of wounded men burst forth upon the
      air, with the clashing din of sabres and small-arms; the mass of cavalry
      appeared to heave and throb like some great monster in its agony. The
      trumpet to retreat sounded, and we galloped back to our lines, leaving
      above five hundred dead behind us, on a field where I had not yet seen the
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Russians were assembling a mighty force around the village;
      for now the cannonade opened with tenfold vigor in front, and fresh guns
      were called up to reply to the fire. Hitherto all was shrouded in the blue
      smoke of the artillery and the dense flakes of the snowdrift, when
      suddenly a storm of wind swept past, carrying with it both sleet and
      smoke; and now, within less than five hundred yards, we beheld the Allied
      armies in front of us. Two of the three villages, which formed our
      advanced position, already had been carried; and towards the third, La
      Bothière, they were advancing quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ney's corps, ordered up to its defence, rushed boldly on, and the
      clattering musketry announced that they were engaged; while twelve guns
      were moved up in full gallop to their support, and opened their fire at
      once. Scarce had they done so, when a wild hurrah was heard; and like a
      whirlwind, a vast mass of cavalry,&mdash;the Cossacks of the Don and the
      Uhlans of the South, commingled and mixed,&mdash;bear down on the guns.
      The struggle is for life or death; no quarter given. Ney recalls his
      columns, and the guns are lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who shall bring the Emperor the tidings?&rdquo; said Tascher, as his voice
      trembled with excitement. &ldquo;I'd rather storm the battery single-handed than
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has seen worse than that already to-day,&rdquo; said an aide-de-camp at our
      side. &ldquo;He has seen Lahorie's squadrons of the Dragoons of the Guard cut to
      pieces by the Russian horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guard! the Guard!&rdquo; repeated Tascher, in accents where doubt and
      despair were blended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes another battalion to certain death!&rdquo; muttered the
      aide-de-camp, as he pointed to a column of grenadiers emerging from the
      front line; &ldquo;see,&mdash;I knew it well,&mdash;they are moving on La
      Bothière. But here comes the Emperor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could detect the figure among the crowd, the staff tore rapidly
      past, followed by a long train of cavalry moving towards the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His favorite stroke,&rdquo; said Tascher: &ldquo;an infantry advance, and a flank
      movement with cavalry.&rdquo; And as the words escaped him, we saw the horsemen
      bearing down at top speed towards the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now we could look no longer; our brigade was ordered to support the
      attack, and we advanced at a trot. The enemy saw the movement, and a great
      mass of cavalry were thrown out to meet it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; was the cry repeated by three or four together, and the
      earth shook as the squadrons came down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our column dashed forward to meet them; when suddenly through the drift we
      beheld a mass of fugitives, scattered and broken, approaching: they were
      our own cavalry, routed in the attempt on the flank, now flying to the
      rear, broken and disordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we could cover their retreat, the enemy were upon us. The shock was
      dreadful, and for some minutes carried all before it; but then rallying,
      the brave horsemen of France closed up and faced the foe. How vain all the
      efforts of the redoubted warrior of the Dnieper and the Wolga against the
      stern soldier of Napoleon! Their sabres flashed like lightning glances,
      and as fatally bore down on all before them; and as the routed squadrons
      fell back, the wild cheers of &ldquo;Vive l'Empereur!&rdquo; told that at least one
      great moment of success atoned for the misfortunes of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Majesty saw your charge, Colonel,&rdquo; said a general officer to Tascher
      as he rode back at the head of a squadron. &ldquo;So gallant a thing as that
      never goes unrewarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tascher's cheek flushed as he bowed in acknowledgment of the praise; but I
      heard him mutter to himself the same instant, &ldquo;Too late! too late!&rdquo; Fatal
      words they were,&mdash;the presage of the mishap they threatened!
    </p>
    <p>
      A great attack on La Rothière was now preparing. It was to be made by
      Napoleon's favorite manoeuvre of cavalry, artillery, and infantry
      combined, each supporting and sustaining the other. Eighteen guns, with
      three thousand sabres, and two columns of infantry numbering four thousand
      each, were drawn up in readiness for the moment to move. Ney received
      orders to lead them, and now they issued forth into the plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our own impatience at not being of the number was quickly merged in
      intense anxiety for the result. It was a gorgeous thing, indeed, to see
      that mighty mass unravelling itself,&mdash;the guns galloping madly to the
      front, supported on either flank by cavalry; while, masked behind, marched
      the black columns of infantry, their tall shakos nodding like the
      tree-tops of a forest. The snow was now falling fast, and the figures grew
      fainter and fainter, and all that remained within our view was the tail of
      the columns, which were only disengaging themselves from the lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deafening cannonade opened from the Allied artillery on the advance,
      unreplied to by our guns, which were ordered not to fire until within half
      range of the enemy. Suddenly a figure is seen emerging from the heavy
      snowdrift at the full speed of his horse; another, and another, follow him
      in quick succession. They make for the position of the Emperor. &ldquo;What can
      it be?&rdquo; cries each, in horrible suspense; &ldquo;see, the columns have halted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dreadful tidings! The guns are embedded in the soft ground,&mdash;the
      horses cannot stir them; one-half of the distance is scarcely won, and
      there they are beneath the withering cannonade of the Allied guns,
      powerless and immovable! Cavalry are dismounted, and the horses harnessed
      to the teams: all in vain! the wheels sink deeper in the miry earth. And
      now the enemy have found out the range, and their shot are sweeping
      through the dense mass with frightful slaughter. Again the aides-de-camp
      hasten to the rear for orders. But Ney can wait no longer; he launches his
      cavalry at the foe, and orders up the infantry to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile a great cloud of cavalry issues from the Allied lines, and
      directs its course towards the flank of the column: the Emperor sees the
      danger, and despatches one of his staff to prepare them to receive
      cavalry. Too late! too late!&mdash;the snowdrift has concealed the
      advance, and the wild horsemen of the desert ride down on the brave ranks.
      Disorder and confusion ensue; the column breaks and scatters. The lancers
      pursue the fugitives through the plain; and before the very eyes of the
      Emperor, the Guard&mdash;his Guard&mdash;are sabred and routed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to become of our cavalry?&rdquo; is now the cry, for they have advanced
      unsupported against the village. Dreadful moment of suspense! None can see
      them; the guns lie deserted, alike by friend and foe. Who dares approach
      them now? &ldquo;They are cheering yonder,&rdquo; exclaimed an officer: &ldquo;I hear them
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hussars, to the front!&rdquo; calls out Damrémont,&mdash;&ldquo;to your comrades'
      rescue! Men, yonder!&rdquo; and he points in the direction of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like an eagle on the swoop, the swift squadrons skim the plain, and mount
      the slope beyond it. The drift clears, and what a spectacle is before us!
      The cavalry are dismounted; their horses, dead or dying, cumber the
      ground; the men, sabre in hand, have attacked the village by assault. Two
      of the enemy's guns are taken and turned against them, and the walls are
      won in many places. An opening in the enclosure of a farmyard admits our
      leading squadron, and in an instant we have taken them in flank and rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russians will neither retreat nor surrender, and the carnage is awful;
      for though overpowered by numbers, they still continue the slaughter, and
      deal death while dying. The chief farmhouse of the village has been
      carried by our troops, but the enemy still holds the garden: the low hedge
      offers a slight obstacle, and over it we dash, and down upon them ride the
      gallant Tenth with cheers of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the crashing sound of cannon-shot among masonry is heard.
      It is the Allied artillery, which, regardless of their own troops, has
      opened on the village. Every discharge tells; the range is at quarter
      distance, and whole files fall at every fire. The trumpet sounds a
      retreat; and I am endeavoring to collect my scattered followers, when my
      eye falls on the aigulet of a general officer among the heap of dead; and
      at the same time I perceive that some old and gallant officer has fallen
      sword in hand, for his long white hair is strewn loosely across his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spring down from my horse and push back the snowy locks, and with a
      shriek of horror I recognize the friend of my heart,&mdash;General
      d'Auvergne. I lift him in my arms, and search for the wound. Alas! a
      grapeshot had torn through his chest, and cut asunder that noble heart
      whose every beat was honor. Though still warm, no ray of life remained:
      the hand I had so often grasped in friendship, I wrung now in the last
      energy of despair, and fell upon the corpse in the agony of my grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was falling fast. All was still around me; none remained near;
      the village was deserted. The deafening din of the cannonade continued,
      and at times some straggling shot crashed through the crumbling walls, and
      brought them thundering to the earth; but all had fled. By the pale
      crescent of a new moon I dug a grave beneath the ruined wall of the
      farmhouse. The labor was long and tedious; but my breaking heart took no
      note of time. My task completed, I sat down beside the grave, and taking
      his now cold hand in mine, pressed it to my lips. Oh, could I have shared
      that narrow bed of clay, what rapture would it have brought to my
      sorrowing soul! I lifted the body and laid it gently in the earth; and as
      I arose, I found that something had entangled itself in my uniform, and
      held me. It seemed a locket, which he wore by a ribbon round his neck. I
      detached it from its place, and put it in my bosom. One lock of the snowy
      hair I severed from his noble head, and then covered up the grave. &ldquo;Adieu
      forever!&rdquo; I muttered, as I wandered from the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the death of a true D'Auvergne,&mdash;&ldquo;on the field of battle!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. THE BRIDGE OF MONTEREAU
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ere I left the village, a shower of shells was thrown into it from the
      French lines, and in a few minutes the whole blazed up in a red flame, and
      threw a wide glare over the battlefield. Spurring my horse to his speed, I
      galloped onward, and now discovered that our troops were retiring in all
      haste. The Allies had won the battle, and we were falling back on Brienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving seventy-three guns in the hands of the enemy, above one thousand
      prisoners, and six thousand killed in battle, Napoleon drew off his
      shattered forces, and marched through the long darkness of a winter's
      night. Thus ended the battle of Arcis-sur-Aube,&mdash;the most fatal for
      the hopes of the Emperor since the dreadful day of Leipzic.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that hour Fortune seemed to frown on those whose arms she had so
      often crowned with victory; and he himself, the mighty leader of so many
      conquering hosts, stood at the window of the château at Brienne the whole
      night long, dreading lest the enemy should be on his track. He whose
      battles were wont to be the ovations of a conqueror, now beheld with joy
      his masses retiring unpursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should I dwell on a career of disaster, or linger on the expiring
      moments of a mighty Empire? Of what avail now are the reinforcements which
      arrived to our aid,&mdash;the veteran legions of the Peninsula? The cry is
      ever, &ldquo;Too late! too late!&rdquo; Dreadful words, heard at every moment! sad
      omens of an army devoted and despairing!
    </p>
    <p>
      From Brienne we retreat to Troyes; from thence to Bar-sur-Aube,&mdash;ever
      nearer and nearer to that capital to which the Allies tend with wild
      shouts of triumph. On the last day of February our headquarters are at
      Nogent, not thirty leagues from Paris,&mdash;Nogent, with the great forest
      of Fontainebleau on its left; and Meaux, the ancient bishopric of the
      Monarchy, on its right; and behind that screen, Paris!
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Bourmont in command of the line which holds the Austrians in
      check, the Emperor himself hastens to oppose Blücher,&mdash;the most
      intrepid and the most daring of all his enemies. A cross-march in the
      depth of winter, with the ground covered with half-frozen snow, will bring
      him on the flank of the Prussian army. It is dared! Dangers and
      difficulties beset every step; the artillery are almost lost, the cavalry
      exhausted. But the cry of &ldquo;The enemy!&rdquo; rouses every energy: they debouch
      on the plain of Champ-Aubert, to fall on the moving column of the Russians
      under Alsufief. Glorious stroke of fate! Victory again caresses the
      spoiled child of fortune: the enemy is routed, and retires on Montmirail
      and Châlons. The advanced army of the Prussians hear the cannonade, and
      fall back to support the Allies on Montmirail. But the Emperor already
      awaits them with the battalions of the Old Guard, and another great battle
      ends in victory. Areola and Rivoli were again remembered, and recalled by
      victories not less glorious; and once more hope returned to the ranks it
      seemed to have quitted forever. Another dreadful blow is aimed at
      Blucher's columns; Marmont attacks them at Vaux-Champs, and the army of
      Silesia falls back beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the Emperor hastens towards Nogent, where he has left Bourmont in
      front of the Austrians. &ldquo;Too late! too late!&rdquo; is again the cry,&mdash;the
      columns of Oudinot and Victor are already in retreat. Schwartzenberg, with
      a force triple their own, advances on the plains of the Seine; the
      Cossacks bivouac in the forest of Fontainebleau. Staff-officers hurry
      onward with the news that the Emperor is approaching; the victorious army
      which had subdued Blucher is on the march, reinforced by the veteran
      cavalry of Spain and the tried legions of the Peninsula. They halt, and
      form in battle. The Allies arrest their steps at Nangis, and again are
      beaten: Nangis becomes another name of glory to the ears of Frenchmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me rest one instant in this rapid recital of a week whose great deeds
      not even Napoleon's life can show the equal of,&mdash;the last flash of
      the lamp of glory ere it darkened forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days had elapsed from the sad hour in which I laid my dearest friend
      in his grave, ere I opened the locket I had taken from his bosom. The wild
      work of war mingled its mad excitement in my brain with thoughts of deep
      sorrow; and I lived in a kind of fevered dream, and hurried from the
      affliction which beset me into the torrent of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gambler who cares not to win rarely loses, so he that seeks death in
      battle comes unscathed through every danger. Each day I threw myself
      headlong into some post where escape seemed scarcely possible; but
      recklessness has its own armor of safety. On the field of Montmirail I was
      reported to the Emperor; and for an attack on the Austrian rearguard at
      Melun made colonel of a cuirassier regiment on the field of battle. Such
      promotions rained on every side: hundreds were falling each day; many
      regiments were commanded by officers of twenty-three or twenty-four years
      of age. Few expected to carry their new epaulettes beyond the engagement
      they gained them in; none believed the Empire itself could survive the
      struggle. Each played for a mighty stake; few cared to outlive the game
      itself. The Emperor showered down favors on the heads which each
      battlefield laid low.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the return from Melun I first opened the locket, which I
      continued to wear around my neck. In the full expansion of a momentary
      triumph to see myself at the head of a regiment, I thought of him who
      would have participated in my pride. I was sitting in the doorway of a
      little cabaret on the roadside, my squadrons picketed around me, for a
      brief halt; and as my thoughts recurred to the brave D'Auvergne, I
      withdrew the locket from my bosom. It was a small oval case of gold,
      opening by a spring. I touched this, and as I did so, the locket sprang
      open, and displayed before me a miniature of Marie de Meudon. Yes!
      beautiful as I had seen her in the forest of Versailles: her dark hair
      clustering around her noble brow,&mdash;and her eyes, so full of tender
      loveliness, shadowed by their deep fringes,&mdash;were there as I
      remembered them; the lips were half parted, as though the artist had
      caught the speaking expression,&mdash;and as-I gazed, I could fancy that
      voice, so musically sweet, still ringing in my ears. I could not look on
      it enough: the features recalled the scenes when first I met her; and the
      strong current of love, against which so long I struggled and contended,
      flowed on with tenfold force once more. Should we ever meet again,&mdash;and
      how? were the questions which rushed to my mind, and to which hope and
      fear dictated the replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The locket was a present from the Empress to the general,&mdash;at least,
      so I interpreted an inscription on the back; and this&mdash;shall I
      confess it?&mdash;brought pleasure to my heart. Like one whose bosom bore
      some wondrous amulet, some charm against the approach of danger, I now
      rode at the head of my gallant band. Life had grown dearer to me, without
      death becoming more dreaded. Her image next my heart made me feel as if I
      should combat beneath her very eyes, and I burned to acquit myself as
      became one who loved her. A wild, half frantic joy animated me as I went,
      and was caught by the gay companions around me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight a despatch reached me, ordering me to hasten forward by a
      forced march to Montereau, the bridge of which town was a post of the
      greatest importance, and must be held against the Austrians till Victor
      could come up. We lost not a moment. It was a calm frosty night, with a
      bright moon, and we hastened along without halting. About an hour before
      daybreak we were met by a cavalry patrol, who informed us that Gérard and
      Victor had both arrived, but too late: Montereau was held by the
      Wurtemberg troops, who garrisoned the village, and defended the bridge
      with a strong force of artillery; twice the French troops had been beaten
      back with tremendous loss, and all looked for the morrow to renew the
      encounter. We continued our journey; and, as the sun was rising,
      discovered, at a distance on the road beside the river, the mass of an
      infantry column: it was the Emperor himself, come up with the Guard, to
      attack the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the preparations for a fierce assault were in progress. A battery
      of twelve guns was posted on a height to command the bridge; another,
      somewhat more distant, overlooked the village itself. Different bodies of
      infantry and cavalry were disposed wherever shelter presented itself, and
      ready for the command to move forward. The approach to the bridge was by a
      wide road, which lay for some distance along the river bank; and this was
      deeply channelled by the enemy's artillery, which, stationed on and above
      the bridge, seemed to defy any attempt to advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never, indeed, did an enterprise seem more full of danger. Every house
      which looked on the bridge was crenelated for small-arms, and garrisoned
      by sharpshooters,&mdash;the fierce Jager of Germany, whose rifles are the
      boast of the Vaterland. Cannon bristled along the heights; their wide
      mouths pointed to that devoted spot, already the grave of hundreds.
      Withdrawn under cover of a steep hill, my regiment was halted, with two
      other heavy cavalry corps, awaiting orders; and from the crest of the
      ridge I could observe the first movements of the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, a fierce cannonade was opened from either side; which, directed
      mainly against the artillery itself, merely resulted in dismantling a
      stray battery here and there, without further damage. At last the hoarse
      roll of a drum was heard, and the head of an infantry column was seen
      advancing up the road. They passed beneath a rock on which a little group
      of officers were standing, and as they went a cheer of &ldquo;Vive l'Empereur!&rdquo;
       broke from them. I strained my eyes towards the place, for now I knew the
      Emperor himself was there. I could not, however, detect him in the crowd,
      who all waved their hats in encouragement to the troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they went, descending a steep declivity of the highroad to the bridge.
      Suddenly the cannonade redoubles from the side of the enemy; the shot
      whistles through the air, while ten thousand muskets peal forth together.
      I rivet my eyes to watch the column. But what is my horror to perceive
      that none appear upon the ridge! The masses move up; they mount the
      ascent; they disappear behind it; and then are lost to sight forever. Not
      one escapes the dreadful havoc of the guns, which from a distance of less
      than two hundred yards enfilades the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still they moved up. I could hear, from where ï lay, the commands of
      the officers, as they gave the word to their companies: no fear nor
      hesitation,&mdash;there they went to death; in less than fifteen minutes
      twelve hundred fell, dead or wounded. And at last the signal to fall back
      was given, and the shattered fragment of a column reeled back behind the
      ridge. Again the cannonade opened, and increasing on both sides, was
      maintained for above an hour without intermission. During this, our guns
      did tremendous execution on the village, but without effecting anything of
      importance respecting the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grenadiers of the Guard had reached the scene of combat, by forced
      marches, from Nangis; and after a brief time to recruit their strength,
      were now ordered up. What a splendid force that massive column,
      conspicuous by their scarlet shoulder-knots and tall shakos of black
      bearskin! with what confidence they move! They halt beneath the rock. The
      Emperor is there too. And see! the officer who stands beside him descends
      from the height, and puts himself at the head of the column: it is Guyot,
      the colonel of the battalion; he waves his plumed hat in answer to the
      Emperor,&mdash;that salute is the last he shall ever give on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drums roll out; but the hoarse shout of &ldquo;En avant!&rdquo; drowns their
      tumult. On they rush; they are over the height; they disappear down the
      descent. And see! there they are on the bridge! &ldquo;Vive la Garde!&rdquo; shouted
      ten thousand of their comrades, who watch them from the heights; &ldquo;Vive la
      Garde!&rdquo; is echoed from the tall cliffs beyond the river. The column moves
      on, and already reaches the middle of the bridge, when eighteen guns throw
      their fire into it: the blue smoke rolls down the rocky heights and
      settles on the bridge, broken here and there by flashes, like the forked
      gleam of lightning; the cloud passes oyer; the bridge is empty, save of
      dead and dying: the Grenadiers of the Guard are no more!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What heart is his who gives his fellow-men to death like this!&rdquo; was my
      exclamation as I witnessed this terrible struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cuirassiers and Carbineers of the Guard to form by threes in column
      of attack!&rdquo; shouted an aide-de-camp, as he rode up to where I lay. And no
      more thought had I of <i>his</i> motives, who now opened the path of glory
      to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squadrons were arrayed under cover of the ridge; the shot and shells
      from the enemy's batteries flew thickly over us,&mdash;a presage of the
      storm we were about to meet. The order to mount was given; and as the men
      sprang into their saddles, a group of horsemen galloped rapidly round the
      angle of the cliff, and approached. One glance showed me it was the
      Emperor and his staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cuirassiers of the Guard,&rdquo; said he, as with raised chapeau he saluted his
      brave followers, &ldquo;I have ordered two battalions to carry that bridge; they
      have failed. Let those who never fail advance to the storm. Montereau
      shall be inscribed on your helmets, men, when I see you on yonder heights.
      Go forward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward! forward!&rdquo; shouted the mailed ranks, half maddened by the
      exciting presence of Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The force was formed in four separate columns of attack: the First
      Cuirassiers leading; followed by the Carbineers of the Guard; then my own
      regiment; and lastly, the Fourth, the corps of poor Pioche. What would I
      have given to know he was there! But there was not time for such inquiry
      now. The squadrons were ready awaiting the moment to dash on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud detonation of nigh twenty guns shook the earth; and in the smoke
      that rolled from them the bridge was concealed from view. A trumpet
      sounded, and the cry of &ldquo;Charge!&rdquo; followed. The mass sprang forth. What a
      cheer was theirs as they swept past! The cannonade opens again; the whole
      ground trembles. The musketry follows; and the clatter of a thousand
      sabres mingles with the war-cries of the combatants. It is but brief,&mdash;the
      tumult is already subsiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now comes the order for the carbineers to move up; the cuirassiers
      have been cut to pieces. A few, mangled and bleeding, have reeled back
      behind the hill; but the regiment is gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the troops of Wagram and Eylau?&rdquo; said the Emperor, in
      bitterness, as he saw the one broken squadron, sole remnant of a gallant
      corps, reeling, bloodstained and dying, to the rear. &ldquo;Where is that
      cavalry that carried the Russian battery at Moskowa? You are not what you
      once were!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This cruel taunt, at the very moment when the earth was steeped in the
      blood of his brave soldiers, was heard in mournful silence. None spoke a
      word, but with clenched lip and clasped hand sat waiting the command to
      charge. It came; but no cheer followed. The carbineers dashed on, prepared
      to die: what death so dreadful as the cold irony of Napoleon!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;En avant! cuirassiers of the Tenth,&rdquo; called out the Emperor, as the last
      squadrons of the carbineers went by, &ldquo;support your comrades! Follow up
      there, men of the Fourth! I must have that bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now the whole line moved up. As we turned the cliff in full trot, the
      scene of combat lay before us: the terrible bridge now actually choked up
      with dead and wounded, the very battlements strewn with corpses. In an
      instant the carbineers were upon it; and struggling through the mass of
      carnage, they rode onward. Like men goaded to despair, they pressed on,
      and actually reached the archway beyond, which, defended by a strong gate,
      closed up the way. Whole files now fell at every discharge; but others
      took their places, to fall as rapidly beneath the murderous musketry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A petard to the gate!&rdquo; is now the cry,&mdash;&ldquo;a petard, and the bridge is
      won!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quick as lightning, four sappers of the Guard rush across the road and
      gain the bridge. They carry some thing between them, but soon are lost in
      the dense masses of the horse. The enemy's fire redoubles; the bridge
      crashes beneath the cannonade, when a loud shout is raised,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the cavalry fall back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cheer of triumph breaks from the town as they behold the retiring
      squadrons; they know not that the petard is now attached to the gate, and
      that the horsemen are merely withdrawn for the explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridge is cleared, and every eye is turned to watch the discharge
      which shall break the strong door, and leave the passage open. But
      unhappily the fuze has missed, and the great engine lies inert and
      inactive. What is to be done? The cavalry cannot venture to approach the
      spot, which at any moment may explode with ruin on every side; and thus
      the bridge is rendered impregnable by our own fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fatality upon fatality!&rdquo; is the exclamation of Napoleon, as he heard the
      tidings. &ldquo;This to the man who puts a match to the fuze!&rdquo; said he, as he
      detaches the great cross of the Legion from his breast, and holds it
      aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one spring I jump from my saddle, and dash at the burning match a
      gunner is holding near me. A rush is made by several others; but I am
      fleetest of foot, and before they reach the road I am on the bridge. The
      enemy has not seen me, and I am half-way across before a shot is aimed at
      me. Even then a surprise seems to arrest their fire, for it is a single
      ball whizzes past. I see the train; I kneel down; the fuze is faint, and I
      stoop to blow it; and then my action is perceived, and a shattering volley
      sweeps the bridge. The high projecting parapet protects me, and I am
      unhurt. But the fuze will not take: horrible moment of agonizing suspense,&mdash;the
      powder is clotted with blood, and will not ignite! I remember that my
      pistols are in my belt, and detaching one, I draw the charge, and scatter
      the fresh powder along the line. My shelter still saves me, though the
      balls are crashing like hail around me. It takes, it takes! the powder
      spits and flashes, and a loud cry from my comrades bursts out, &ldquo;Come back!
      come back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forgetting everything in the intense anxiety of the moment, I spring to my
      legs; but scarce is my head above the parapet when a bullet strikes me in
      the chest. I fall covered with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save him! save him!&rdquo; is the cry of a thousand voices; and a rush is made
      upon the bridge. The musketry opens on these brave fellows, and they fall
      back wounded and discouraged.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Crouching beneath the parapet, I try to stanch my wound; but the blood is
      gushing in torrents, my senses are reeling, the objects around grow
      dimmer, the noise seems fainter. But suddenly I feel a hand upon my neck,
      and at the same instant a flask is pressed to my lips. I drink, and the
      wine rallies me; the bleeding is stopped. My eyes open again; and dare I
      trust their evidence? Who is it that now shelters beneath the parapet
      beside me? Minette, the vivandière! her handsome face flushed, her eyes
      wild with excitement, and her brown hair in great tangled masses on her
      back and shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minette, is it indeed thee?&rdquo; said I, pressing her hand to my lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you at the head of your regiment some days ago, and I thought we
      should meet ere long. But lie still; we are safe here. The fire slackens
      too; they have fallen back since the gate was forced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the gate forced, Minette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, the petard has done its work; but the columns are not come up. Lie
      still till they pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear girl! what a brave heart is thine!&rdquo; said I, gazing on her
      beautiful features, tenfold handsomer from the expression which her
      heroism had lent them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would surely adventure as much for me,&rdquo; said she, half-timidly, as
      she pressed her handkerchief against the wound, which still oozed blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The action entangled her fingers in a ribbon. She tried to extricate them;
      and the locket fell out, opening by accident at the same moment. With a
      convulsive energy she clasped the miniature in both hands, and riveted her
      eyes upon it. The look was wild as that of madness itself, and her
      features grew stiff as she gazed, while the pallor of death overspread
      them. It was scarce the action of a second; in another, she flung back the
      picture from her and sprang to her feet. One glance she gave me, fleeting
      as the lightning flash, but how full of storied sorrow!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment after she was in the middle of the bridge. She waved her cap
      wildly above her head, and beckoned to the column to come on. A cheer
      answered her. The mass rushed forward; the fire again pealed forth; a
      shriek pierced the din of all the battle, and the leading files halt. Four
      grenadiers fall back to the rear, carrying a body between them: it is the
      corpse of Minette the vivandière, who has received her death-wound!

    <p>
      The same evening saw me the occupant of a bed in the ambulance of the
      Guard. Dreadful as the suffering of my wound was, I carried a deeper one
      within my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Emperor has given you his own cross of the Legion, sir,&rdquo; said the
      surgeon, endeavoring to rally me from a dejection whose source he knew
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has made him a general of brigade, too,&rdquo; said a voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was General Letort who spoke; he had that moment come from the Emperor
      with the tidings. I buried my head beneath my hands, and felt as though my
      heart was bursting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a gallant girl, that vivandière,&rdquo; said the rough old general;
      &ldquo;she must have had a soldier's heart within that corsage. <i>Parbleu!</i>
      I'd rather not have another such in my brigade, though, after what
      happened this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you speak of?&rdquo; said I, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They gave her a military funeral this evening,&mdash;the Fourth
      Cuirassiers. The Emperor gave his permission, and sent General Degeon of
      the staff to be present. And when they placed her in the grave, one of the
      soldiers,&mdash;a corporal, I believe,&mdash;kneeled down to kiss her
      before they covered in the earth; and when he had done so, he lay slowly
      down on his face on the grass. 'He has fainted,' said one of his comrades;
      and they turned him on his back. <i>Morbleu!</i> it was worse than that:
      he was stone dead,&mdash;one of the very finest fellows of the regiment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! I know him,&rdquo; muttered I, endeavoring to smother my emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general looked at me as if my mind was wandering, and briefly added,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so they laid them in the same grave, and the same fusillade gave the
      last honors to both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your story has affected my patient overmuch, General,&rdquo; said the doctor;
      &ldquo;you must leave him to himself for some time.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. FONTAINEBLEAU
    </h2>
    <p>
      An order from Berthier, written at the command of the Emperor, admitted me
      into the ancient Palace of Fontainebleau, where I lay for upwards of two
      months under my wound. Twice had fever nearly brought me to the grave; but
      youth and unimpaired health succored me, and I rallied through all. A
      surgeon of the staff accompanied me, and by his kind companionship, not
      less than by his skill, did I recover from an illness where sorrow had
      made an iron inroad not less deep than disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my little chamber, which looked out upon the courtyard of the Palace, I
      passed my days, thinking over the past and all its vicissitudes. Each day
      we learned some intelligence either from the seat of war or from Paris:
      defeat in one, treason and disaffection in the other, were rapidly
      hastening the downfall of the mightiest Empire the genius of man had ever
      constructed. Champ-Aubert, Montmirail, and Montereau, great victories as
      they were, retarded not the current of events. &ldquo;The week of glory&rdquo; brought
      not hope to a cause predestined to ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the latter end of March. For some days previous the surgeon had
      left me to visit an outpost ambulance near Melun, and I was alone. My
      strength, however, enabled me to sit up at my window; and even in this
      slight pleasure my wearied senses found enjoyment, after the tedious hours
      of a sickbed. The evening was calm, and for the season mild and
      summerlike. The shrubs were putting forth their first leaves, and around
      the marble fountains the spring flowers were already showing signs of
      blossom. The setting sun made the tall shadows of the ancient beech-trees
      stretch across the wide court, where all was still as at midnight. No
      inhabitant of the Palace was about; not a servant moved, not a footstep
      was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment of such perfect stillness as leads the mind to reverie;
      and my thoughts wandered away to that distant time when gay cavaliers and
      stately dames trod those spacious terraces,&mdash;when tales of chivalry
      and love mingled with the plashing sounds of those bright fountains, and
      the fair moon looked down on more lovely forms than even those graceful
      marbles around. I fancied the time when the horn of the chasseur was
      heard-echoing through those vast courts, its last notes lost in the merry
      voices of the cortege round the monarch. And then I called up the
      brilliant group, with caracoling steeds and gay housings, proudly
      advancing up that great avenue to the royal entrance, and pictured the
      ancient ceremonial that awaited his coming,&mdash;the descendant of a long
      line of kings. The frank and kingly Francis, the valiant Henry the Fourth,
      the &ldquo;Grand Monarch&rdquo; himself,&mdash;all passed in review before my mind as
      once they lived, and moved, and spoke in that stately pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set: the mingled shadows threw their gloom over the wide
      court, and one wing of the Palace was in' deep shade, when suddenly I
      heard the roll of wheels and the tramp of horses on the distant road. I
      listened attentively. They were coming near; I could hear the tread of
      many together; and my practised ear could detect the clank of dragoons, as
      their sabres and sabretasches jingled against the horses' flanks. &ldquo;Some
      hurried news from the Emperor,&rdquo; thought I; &ldquo;perhaps some marshal wounded,
      and about to be conveyed to the Palace.&rdquo; The same instant the guard at the
      distant entrance beat to arms, and an equipage drawn by six horses dashed
      in at full gallop; a second followed as fast, with a peloton of dragoons
      at the side. My anxiety increased. &ldquo;What if it were the Emperor himself!&rdquo;
       thought I. But as the idea flashed across me, it yielded at once on seeing
      that the carriages did not draw up at the grand stair, but passed on to a
      low and private door at the distant wing of the Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bustle of the cortege arriving was but a moment's work. The carriages
      moved rapidly away, the dragoons disappeared, and all was as still as
      before, leaving me to ponder over the whole, and actually ask myself could
      it have been reality? I opened my door to listen; but not a sound awoke
      the echo of the long corridors. One could have fancied that no living
      thing was beneath that wide roof, so silent was all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange feeling of anxiety,&mdash;the dread of something undefined, I
      knew not what, or whence coming,&mdash;was over me, and my nerves, long
      irritable from illness, became now jarringly sensitive, and banished all
      thought of sleep. Wild fancies and incoherent ideas crossed my mind, and
      made me restless and uneasy. I felt, too, as if the night were unusually
      close and sultry, and I opened my window to admit the air. Scarcely had I
      drawn the curtain aside, when my eye rested on a long line of light, that,
      issuing from a window on the ground-floor of the Palace, threw its bright
      gleam far across the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the same wing where the carriages drew up. It must be so; some
      officer of rank, wounded in a late battle, was brought there. &ldquo;Poor
      fellow!&rdquo; thought I; &ldquo;what suffering may he be enduring amid all the
      peace-fulness and calm of this tranquil spot! Who can it be?&rdquo; was the
      ever-recurring question to my mind; for my impression had already
      strengthened itself to a conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours went on; the light shone steadily as at first, and the stillness
      was unbroken. Wearied with thinking, and half forgetful of my weakness, I
      tottered along the corridor, descended the grand stair, and passed out
      into the court. How refreshing did the night air feel! how sweet the fair
      odors of the spring, as, wafted by the motion of the <i>jet d'eau</i>,
      they were diffused around! The first steps of recovery from severe
      sickness have a strange thrill of youthfulness about them. Our senses seem
      once more to revel in the simple enjoyments of early days, and to feel
      that their greatest delight lies in the associations which gave pleasure
      to childhood. Weaned from the world's contentions, we seem to have been
      lifted for the time above the meaner cares and ambitions of life, and love
      to linger a little longer in that ideal state of happiness calm thoughts
      bestow; and thus the interval that brings back health to the body restores
      freshness to the heart, and purified in thought, we come forth hoping for
      better things, and striving for them with all the generous ardor of early
      years. How happy was I as I wandered in that garden! how full of gratitude
      to feel the current of health once more come back in all my veins,&mdash;the
      sense of enjoyment which flows from every object of the fair world
      restored to me, after so many dangers and escapes!
    </p>
    <p>
      As I moved slowly through the terraced court, my eye was constantly
      attracted to the small and starlike light which glimmered through the
      darkness; and I turned to it at last, impelled by a feeling of undefinable
      sympathy. Following a narrow path, I drew near to a little garden, which
      once contained some rare flowers. They had been favorites of poor
      Josephine in times past; but the hour was over in which that gave them a
      claim to care and attention, and now they were wild grown and tangled, and
      almost concealed the narrow walk which led to the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reached this at length; and as I stood, the faint moonlight, slanting
      beneath a cloud, fell upon a bright and glistening object almost at my
      feet. I stepped back, and looked fixedly at it. It was the figure of a man
      sleeping across the entrance of the porch. He was dressed in Mameluke
      fashion; but his gay trappings and rich costume were travel-stained and
      splashed. His unsheathed cimeter lay grasped in one hand, and a Turkish
      pistol seemed to have fallen from the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even by the imperfect light I recognized Rustan, the favorite Mameluke of
      the Emperor, who always slept at the door of his tent and his chamber,&mdash;his
      chosen bodyguard. Napoleon must then be here; his equipage it was which
      arrived so hurriedly; his the light which burned through the stillness of
      the night. As these thoughts followed fast on one another, I almost
      trembled to think how nearly I had ventured on his presence, where none
      dared to approach unbidden. To retire quickly and noiselessly was now my
      care. But my first step entangled my foot; I stumbled. The noise awoke the
      sleeping Turk, and with a loud cry for the guard he sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La garde!&rdquo; called he a second time, forgetting in his surprise that none
      was there. But then with a spring he seized me by the arm, and as his
      shining weapon gleamed above my head, demanded who I was, and for what
      purpose there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first words of my reply were scarcely uttered, when a small door was
      opened within the vestibule, and the Emperor appeared. Late as was the
      hour, he was dressed, and even wore his sword at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What means this? Who are you, sir?&rdquo; was the quick, sharp question he
      addressed to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few words&mdash;the fewest in which I could convey it&mdash;told my
      story, and expressed my sorrow, that in the sick man's fancy of a
      moonlight walk I should have disturbed his Majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, Sire,&rdquo; added I, &ldquo;that your Majesty was many a league distant
      with the army&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no army, sir,&rdquo; interrupted he, with a rapid gesture of his hand;
      &ldquo;to-morrow there will be no Emperor. Go, sir; go, while it is yet the
      time. Offer your sword and your services where so many others, more
      exalted than yourself, have done. This is the day of desertion; see that
      you take advantage of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had my name and rank been less humble, they would have assured your
      Majesty how little I merited this reproach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to have offended you,&rdquo; replied he, in a voice of inexpressible
      softness. &ldquo;You led the assault at Montereau? I remember you now. I should
      have given you your brigade, had I&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped here suddenly, while
      an expression of suffering passed across his pale features; he rallied
      from it, however, in an instant, and resumed, &ldquo;I should have known you
      earlier; it is too late! Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He inclined his head slightly as he spoke, and extended his hand. I
      pressed it fervently to my lips, and would have spoken, but I could not.
      The moment after he was gone.

      beneath the blackened walls of Moscow; repeated at every new disaster of
      that dreadful retreat; now spoken by him whose fortune they predicted. Too
      late!&mdash;the exclamation of the proud marshal, harassed by unsuccessful
      efforts to avert the destiny he saw inevitable. Too late!&mdash;the cry of
      the wearied soldier. Too late!&mdash;the fatal expression of the Czar when
      the brave and faithful Macdonald urged the succession of the King of Rome
      and the regency of the Empress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearied with a wakeful night, I fell into a slumber towards morning, when
      I started suddenly at the roll of drums in the court beneath. In an
      instant I was at my window. What was my astonishment to perceive that the
      courtyard was filled with troops! The Grenadiers of the Guard were ranged
      in order of battle, with several squadrons of the chasseurs and the horse
      artillery; while a staff of general officers stood in the midst, among
      whom I recognized Belliard, Montesquieu, and Turenne,&mdash;great names,
      and worthy to be recorded for an act of faithful devotion. The Duc de
      Bassano was there too, in deep mourning; his pale and careworn face
      attesting the grief within his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roll of the drums continued; the deep, unbroken murmur of the salute
      went on from one end of the line to the other. It ceased; and ere I could
      question the reason, the various staff-officers became uncovered, and
      stood in attitudes of respectful attention, and the Emperor himself
      slowly, step by step, descended the wide stair of the &ldquo;Cheval Blanc,&rdquo;&mdash;as
      the grand terrace was styled,&mdash;and advanced towards the troops. At
      the same instant the whole line presented arms, and the drums beat the
      salute. They ceased, and Napoleon raised his hand to command silence, and
      throughout that crowded mass not a whisper was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could perceive that he was speaking, but the words did not reach me.
      Eloquent and burning words they were, and to be recorded in history to the
      remotest ages. I now saw that he had finished, as General Petit sprang
      forward with the eagle of the First Regiment of the Guards, and presented
      it to him. The Emperor pressed it fervently to his lips, and then threw
      his arms round Petit's neck; while suddenly disengaging himself, he took
      the tattered flag that waved above him, and kissed it twice. Unable to
      bear up any longer, the worn, hard-featured veterans sobbed aloud like
      children, and turned away their faces to conceal their emotion. No cry of
      &ldquo;Vive l'Empereur!&rdquo; resounded now through those ranks where each had
      willingly shed his heart's blood for him. Sorrow had usurped the place of
      enthusiasm, and they stood overwhelmed by grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall and soldierlike figure, with head uncovered, approached the
      Emperor, and said a few words. Napoleon waved his hand towards the troops,
      and from the ranks many rushed towards him, and fell on their knees before
      him. He passed his hand across his face and turned away. My eyes grew dim;
      a misty vapor shut out every object, and I felt as though the very lids
      were bursting. The great tramp of horses startled me, and then came the
      roll of wheels. I looked up: an equipage was passing from the gate, a
      peloton of dragoons escorted it; a second followed at full speed. The
      colonels formed their men; the word to march was given; the drums beat
      out; the grenadiers moved on; the chasseurs succeeded; and last the
      artillery rolled heavily up. The court was deserted; not a man remained:
      all, all were gone! The Empire was ended; and the Emperor, the mighty
      genius who created it, on his way to exile!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. THE CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      France never appeared to less advantage in the eyes of Europe than at the
      period I speak of. Scarcely had the proud star of Napoleon set, when the
      whole current of popular favor flowed along with those whom, but a few
      days before, they accounted their greatest enemies. The Russians and the
      Prussians, whom they lampooned and derided, they now flattered and fawned
      on. They deemed no adulation servile enough to lay at the feet of their
      conquerors,&mdash;not esteeming the exaltation of their victors
      sufficient, unless purchased at the sacrifice of their own honor as a
      nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle was no longer who should be first in glory, but who foremost
      in desertion of him and his fortunes whose word had made them. The
      marshals he had created, the generals he had decorated, the ministers and
      princes he had endowed with wealth and territory, now turned from him in
      his hour of misfortune, to court the favor of one against whom every act
      of their former lives was directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      These men, whose very titles recalled the fields of glory to which he led
      them, now hastened to the Tuileries to proffer an allegiance to a monarch
      they neither loved nor respected. Sad and humiliating spectacle! The long
      pent-up hatred of the Royalists found a natural vent in this moment of
      triumphant success. Chateaubriand, Constant, and Madame de Staël led the
      way to those declarations of the press which denounced Napoleon as the
      greatest of earthly tyrants; and inveighed even against his greatness and
      his genius, as though malevolence could produce oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Paris was in a ferment of excitement,&mdash;not the troubled agitation
      of a people whose capital owned the presence of a conquering army, but the
      tumultuous joy of a nation intoxicated with pleasure. Fêtes and balls, gay
      processions and public demonstrations of rejoicing, met one everywhere;
      and ingenuity was taxed to invent flatteries for the very nations whom,
      but a week past, they scoffed at as barbarians and Scythians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sickened and disgusted with the fickleness of mankind, I knew not where to
      turn. My wound had brought on a low, lingering fever, accompanied by
      extreme debility, increased in all likelihood by the harassing reflections
      every object around suggested. I could not venture abroad without meeting
      some evidence of that exuberant triumph by which treachery hopes to cover
      its own baseness; besides, the reputation of being a Napoleonist was now a
      mark for insult and indignity from those who never dared to avow an
      opinion until the tide of fortune had turned in their favor. The white
      cockade had replaced the tricolor; every emblem of the Empire was
      abolished; and that uniform, to wear which was once a mark of honorable
      distinction, was now become a signal for insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was returning one evening from a solitary ramble in the neighborhood of
      Paris,&mdash;for, by some strange fatality, I could not tear myself away
      from the scenes to which the most eventful portions of my life were
      attached,&mdash;and at length reached the Boulevard Montmartre, just as
      the leading squadrons of a cavalry regiment were advancing up the wide
      thoroughfare. I had hitherto avoided every occasion of witnessing any
      military display which should recall the past; but now the rapid gathering
      of the crowd to see the soldiers pass prevented my escape, and I was
      obliged to wait patiently until the cortege should move forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came on in dense column,&mdash;the brave Chasseurs of the Guard, the
      bronzed warriors of Jena and Wigram; but to my eyes they seemed sterner
      and sadder than their wont, and heeded not the loud &ldquo;vivas&rdquo; of the mob
      around them. Where were their eagles? Alas! the white banner that floated
      over their heads was a poor substitute for the proud ensign they had so
      often followed to victory. And here weie the dragoons,&mdash;old
      Kellermann's brave troopers; their proud glances were changed to a
      mournful gaze upon that crowd whose cheers they once felt proud of: and
      there, the artillery, that glorious corps which he loved so well,&mdash;did
      not the roll of their guns sound sorrowfully on the ear!
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed! And then came on a strange cortege of mounted cavaliers,&mdash;old
      and withered men, in uniforms of quaint antique fashion, their chapeaux
      decorated with great cockades of white ribbon, and their sword-knots
      garnished with similar ornaments; the order of St. Louis glittered on each
      breast, and in their bearing you might read the air of men who were
      enjoying a long-wished-for and long-expected triumph. These were the old
      seigneurs of the Monarchy; and truly they were not wanting in that look of
      nobility their ancient blood bestowed. Their features were proud; their
      glance elated; their very port and bearing spoke that consciousness of
      superiority, to crush which had cost all the horrors and bloodshed of a
      terrible Revolution. How strange! it seemed as if many of their faces were
      familiar to me,&mdash;I knew them well; but where, and how, my memory
      could not trace. Yes, now I could recall it: they were the frequenters of
      the old &ldquo;Pension of the Rue de Mi-Carême,&rdquo;&mdash;the same men I had seen
      in their day of adversity, bearing up with noble pride against the ills of
      fortune. There they were, revelling in the long-sought-after restoration
      of their former state. Were they not more worthy of admiration in their
      hour of patient and faithful watching, than in this the period of their
      triumph?
    </p>
    <p>
      The pressure of the crowd obliged the cavalcade to halt. And now the air
      resounded with the cries of &ldquo;Vive le Roi!&rdquo;&mdash;the long-forgotten cheer
      of loyalty. Thousands re-echoed the shout, and the horsemen waved their
      hats in exultation. &ldquo;Vive le Roi!&rdquo; cried the mob, as though the voices had
      not called &ldquo;Vive l'Empereur!&rdquo; but yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with the Napoleonist,&mdash;down with him!&rdquo; screamed a
      savage-looking fellow, who, jammed up in the crowd, pointed towards me, as
      I stood a mere spectator of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cry 'Vive le Roi!' at once,&rdquo; whispered a voice near me, &ldquo;or the
      consequences may be serious. The mob is ungovernable at a moment like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dozen voices shouted out at the same time, &ldquo;Down with him! down with
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off with your hat, sir!&rdquo; said a rude-looking fellow beside me, as he
      raised his hand to remove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your peril!&rdquo; said I, as I clenched my hand, and prepared to strike him
      down the moment he should touch me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were not well uttered, when the crowd closed on me, and a
      hundred arms were stretched out to attack me. In vain all my efforts to
      resist. My hat was torn from my head, and assailed on every side, I was
      dragged into the middle of the street, amid wild cries of vengeance and
      taunting insults. It was then, as I lay overcome by numbers, that a loud
      cry to fall back issued from the cavalcade, and a horseman, sword in hand,
      dashed upon the mob, slashing on every side as he went, mounted on a
      high-mettled horse. He cleared the dense mass with the speed of lightning,
      and drove back my assailants.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch my horse's mane,&rdquo; said he, hurriedly. &ldquo;Hold fast for a few seconds,
      and you are safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following the advice, I held firmly by the long mane of his charger,
      while, clearing away the mob on either side, he protected me by his drawn
      sabre above my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe this time!&rdquo; said he, as we arrived within the ranks. And then
      turning round, so as to face me, added, &ldquo;Safe! and my debt acquitted. You
      saved my life once; and though the peril seemed less imminent now, trust
      me, yours had not escaped the fury of that multitude without me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Henri de Beauvais! Do we meet again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but with altered fortune, Burke. Our king, as the words of our Garde
      Écossaise song says,&mdash;our king 'has got his own again.' The day of
      loyalty has again dawned on France, and a grateful people may carry their
      enthusiasm for the Restoration, even as far as vengeance on their
      opponents, and yet not merit much reproach. But no more of this. We can be
      friends now; or if not, it must be your fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not too proud, De Beauvais, either to accept or acknowledge a favor
      at your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we are friends,&rdquo; said he, joyfully. &ldquo;And in the name of friendship,
      let me beg of you to place this <i>cordon</i> in your hat.&rdquo; And so saying,
      he detached the cockade of white ribbon he wore from his own, and held it
      towards me. &ldquo;Well, then, at least remove the tricolor; it can but expose
      you to insult. Remember, Burke, its day is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not likely to forget it,&rdquo; replied I, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Colonel, his royal highness wishes to speak with you,&rdquo; said
      an aide-de-camp, riding up beside De Beauvais's horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of this gentleman for me,&rdquo; said De Beauvais, pointing to me;
      and then, wheeling round his horse, he galloped at full speed to the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will spare you all trouble on my account, sir,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;My way lies
      yonder, and at present I see no obstacle to my pursuing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me at least send an escort with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him and declined the offer; and leaving the ranks of the
      procession, mingled with the crowd, and in a few minutes after reached my
      hotel without further molestation. The hour was come, I saw plainly, in
      which I must leave France. Not only was every tie which bound me to that
      land severed, but to remain was only to oppose myself singly to the
      downward current of popular opinion which now threatened to overturn every
      landmark and vestige of the Empire. Up to this moment, I never confessed
      to my heart with what secret hope I had prolonged each day of my stay,&mdash;how
      I cherished within me the expectation that I should once again, though but
      for an instant, see her who lived in all my thoughts, and, unknown to my
      self, formed the mainspring of all my actions!
    </p>
    <p>
      This hope only became confessed when about to leave me forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I busied myself in the preparations for departure, a note arrived from
      De Beauvais, stating that he desired particularly to see and confer with
      me that same evening, and requesting me on no account to be from home, as
      his business was most pressing. I felt little curiosity to know to what he
      might allude, and saw him enter my room some hours later without a single
      particle of anxiety as to his communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come, Burke,&rdquo; said he, after a few commonplaces had been exchanged
      between us,&mdash;&ldquo;I am come, Burke, on a mission which I hope you will
      believe the sincerest regard for you has prompted me to undertake, and
      which, whatever objections it may meet with from you, none can arise, I am
      certain, on the score of his fidelity who now makes this proposition to
      you. To be brief: the Count d'Artois has sent me to offer you your grade
      and rank in the army of his Majesty Louis the Eighteenth. Your last
      gazette was as colonel; but there is a rumor you should have received your
      appointment as general of brigade. There will be little difficulty in
      arranging your brevet on that understanding; for your services, brief as
      they were, have not been unnoticed. Marshal Ney himself bears testimony to
      your conduct at Montereau; and your name twice occurs on the list of the
      minister of war for promotion. Strange claims these, you will say, to
      recompense from the rightful sovereign of France, gained as they were in
      the service of the Usurper! But it is the prerogative of legitimacy to be
      great and noble-minded, and to recognize true desert wherever it occurs.
      Come, what say you? Does this proposal meet your wishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If to surpass my expectations, and flatter my pride, were to convince my
      reason, and change my estimation of what is loyal and true, I should say,
      'Yes, De Beauvais; the proposition does meet my wishes.' But not so. I
      wore these epaulettes first in my admiration of him whose fortunes I have
      followed to the last. My pride, my glory, were to be his soldier; that can
      be no longer, and the sword I drew in his cause shall never be unsheathed
      in another's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ignorant that such arguments apply with equal force to all those
      great men who have, within these few weeks past, sworn allegiance to his
      Majesty? What say you to the list of marshals, not one of whom has refused
      the graciously offered favor of his Majesty? Are Ney, Soult, Augereau,
      Macdonald, and Marmont nothing as examples?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not say so, De Beauvais; but this I will say, they had had both
      more respect and esteem from me had they done otherwise. If they were true
      to the Emperor, they can scarce be loyal to the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you not distinguish between the forced services exacted by a tyrant
      and the noble duty rendered to a rightful sovereign?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can better estimate the fascinations which lead men to follow a hero,
      than to be the parade-soldier around the gilded gates of a palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Beauvais's cheek flashed scarlet, and his voice was agitated, as he
      replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nobles of France, sir, have shown themselves as high in deeds of
      chivalry and heroism as they have ever been in the accomplishments of
      true-born gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, De Beauvais! I meant no imputation of them and their motives.
      There is every reason why you and your gallant companions should enjoy the
      favors of that crown your efforts have placed upon the head of the King of
      France. Your true and fitting station is around the throne your bravery
      and devotion have restored. But as for us,&mdash;we who have fought and
      marched, have perilled limb and life, to raise the fortune and elevate the
      glory of him who was the enemy of that sovereign,&mdash;how can we be
      participators in the triumph we labored to avert, and rejoice in a
      consummation we would have died rather than witness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it has come; the fates have decided against you. The cause you would
      serve is not merely unfortunate,&mdash;it is extinct; the Empire has left
      no banner behind it. Come, then, and rally round one whose boast it is to
      number among its followers the high-born and the noble,&mdash;to assert
      the supremacy of rank and worth above the claim of the base and low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot; I must not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, you will wait on the Comte d'Artois. You must see his royal
      highness, and thank him for his gracious intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what that means, De Beauvais; I have heard that few can resist the
      graceful fascinations of the prince's manner. I shall certainly not fear
      to encounter them, however dangerous to my principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not to refuse his royal highness?&rdquo; said he, quickly. &ldquo;I trust you
      will not do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not have me yield to the flattery of a prince's notice what I
      refuse to the solicitations of a friend, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such is your intention,&mdash;your fixed intention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Beauvais turned away impatiently, and leaned on the window for some
      minutes. Then, after a pause, and in a slow and measured voice, added,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are known to the Court, Burke, by other channels than those I have
      mentioned. Your prospects of advancement would be most brilliant, if you
      accept this offer: I scarcely know to what they may not aspire. Reflect
      for a moment or two. There is no desertion,&mdash;no falling off here.
      Remember that the Empire was a vision, and like a dream it has passed
      away. Where there is no cause, there can be no fealty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but a sorry memory, De Beauvais, that only retains while there are
      benefits to receive; mine is a more tenacious one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my mission is ended,&rdquo; cried he, taking up his hat. &ldquo;I may mention to
      his royal highness that you intend returning to England; that you are
      indisposed to service at present. It is unnecessary to state more
      accurately the views you entertain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave the matter completely to your discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, then. Our roads lie widely apart, Burke; and I for one regret it
      deeply. It only remains that I should give you this note; which I promised
      to deliver into your hands in the event of your declining to accept the
      prince's offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blushed deeply, as he placed a small sealed note in my fingers; and as
      if anxious to get away, pressed my hand hurriedly, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      My curiosity to learn the contents of the billet made me tear it open at
      once; but it was not before I had perused it several times that I could
      credit the lines before me. They were but few, and ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      Dear Sir,&mdash;May I request the honor of a visit from you this
      evening at the Hôtel de Grammont?

      Truly yours,

      Marie d'Auvergne, née De Meudon.

      Colonel Burke.
</pre>
    <p>
      How did I read these lines over again and again!&mdash;now interpreting
      them as messengers of future hope; now fearing they might exclude every
      ray of it forever. One solution recurred to me at every moment, and
      tortured me to the very soul. Her family had all been Royalists. The mere
      accidents of youth had thrown her brother into the army, and herself into
      the Court of the Empire, where personal devotion and attachment to the
      Empress had retained her. What if she should exert her influence to induce
      me to accept the prince's offer? How could I resist a request, perhaps an
      entreaty, from her? The more I reflected over it, the more firmly this
      opinion gained ground with me, and the more deeply did I grieve over a
      position environed by such difficulty; and ardently as I longed for the
      moment of meeting her once more, the desire was tempered by a fear that
      the meeting should be our last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eventful moment of my destiny arrived, and found me at the door of the
      Hôtel de Grammont. A valet in waiting for my arrival conducted me to a <i>salon</i>,
      saying the countess would appear in a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an anxious interval was that! I tried to occupy myself with the
      objects around, and distract my attention from the approaching interview;
      but every sound startled me, and I turned at each instant towards the door
      by which I expected her to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time appeared to drag heavily on,&mdash;minutes became like hours; and
      yet no one appeared. My impatience had reached its climax, when I heard my
      name spoken in a low soft voice. I turned, and she was before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dressed in deep mourning, and looked paler, perhaps thinner, than
      I had ever seen her,&mdash;but not less beautiful. Whether prompted by her
      own feelings at the moment, or called up by my unconsciously fixed look,
      she blushed deeply as our eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to leave France, Colonel,&rdquo; said she, as soon as we were
      seated, &ldquo;when I heard from my cousin, De Beauvais, that you were here, and
      delayed my departure to have the opportunity of seeing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused here, and drew a deep breath to continue; but leaning her head
      on her hand, she seemed to have fallen into a reverie for some minutes,
      from which she started suddenly, by saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His royal highness has offered you your grade in the service, I
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame; so my friend De Beauvais informs me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have refused,&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this, sir? Are you so weary of a soldier's life, that you would
      leave it thus early?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was not the reason, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You loved the Emperor, sir,&rdquo; said she, hastily, and with a tone of almost
      passionate eagerness, &ldquo;even as I loved my dear, kind mistress; and you
      felt allegiance to be too sacred a thing to be bartered at a moment's
      notice. Is this the true explanation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am proud to say, you have read my motives; such were they.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are there not many more to act thus?&rdquo; cried she, vehemently. &ldquo;Why do
      not the great names <i>he</i> made glorious, become greater by fidelity
      than ever they were by heroism? There was one, sir, who, had he lived, had
      given this example to the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, most true, Madame. But was not his fate happier than to have
      survived for this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long pause, unbroken by a word on either side, followed; when at last
      she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had left with De Beauvais some few relics of my dear brother, hoping
      you would accept them for his sake. General d'Auvergne's sword,&mdash;the
      same he wore at Jena,&mdash;he desired might be conveyed to you when you
      left the service. These, and this ring,&rdquo; said she, endeavoring to withdraw
      a rich brilliant from her finger, &ldquo;are the few souvenirs I would ask you
      to keep for their sakes, and for mine. You mean to return to England,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame; that is, I had intended,&mdash;I know not now whither I
      shall go. Country has few ties for one like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, must be a wanderer,&rdquo; said she, half musingly, while still she
      endeavored to remove the ring from her finger. &ldquo;I find,&rdquo; said she,
      smiling, &ldquo;I must give you another keepsake; this will not leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it me, then, where it is,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Yes, Marie! the devotion of a
      heart, wholly yours, should not go unrewarded. To you I owe all that my
      life has known of happiness,&mdash;to memory of you, every high and noble
      hope. Let me not, after years of such affection, lose the guiding star of
      my existence,&mdash;all that I have lived for, all that I love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, poured forth with all the passionate energy which a last hope
      inspires, were followed by a story of my long-concealed love. I know not
      how incoherently the tale was told; I cannot say how often I interrupted
      my own recital by some appeal to the past,&mdash;some half-uttered hope
      that she had seen the passion which burned within me. I can but remember
      the bursting feeling of my bosom, as she placed her hand in mine, and
      said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words ended the story of a life whose trials were many, and
      encountered at an age in which few have braved the world's cares. The
      lessons I had learned, however, were acquired in that school,&mdash;adversity,&mdash;where
      few are taught in vain; and if the morning of my life broke in clouds and
      shadow, the noon has been not less peaceful and bright. And the evening,
      as it draws near, comes with an aspect of calm tranquillity, ample enough
      to recompense every vicissitude of those early days when the waves of
      fortune were roughest.

    <h2>
      A PARTING WORD.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      Dear Friends,&mdash;Time has hallowed the custom of a word at
      parting, and I am unwilling to relinquish the privilege. In
      the tale I have just concluded, my endeavor was to portray,
      with as little aid from fiction as might be, some lights and
      shadows of the most wonderful and eventful period of modern
      history,&mdash;the empire of Napoleon. The character I selected
      for my hero was not all imaginary, neither were many of the
      scenes, which bear less apparent proofs of reality. The
      subject was one long meditated on before undertaken; but as
      the work proceeded, I felt at some places, the difficulty of
      creating interest for persons, and incidents removed both by
      time and country from my reader; and at others, my own
      inadequacy to an effort, which mere zeal could never
      accomplish. These causes induced me to deviate from the plan
      I originally set down for my guidance; and combined with
      failing health, have rendered what might have been a matter
      of interest and amusement to the writer, a task of labor and
      anxiety.

      It is the first time I have had to ask my reader's
      indulgence on such grounds; nor should I now allude to it,
      save as affording the only apology I can render for the many
      defects in a story, which, in defiance of me, took its
      coloring from my own mind at the period, rather from the
      reflex of the events I related.

      The moral of my tale is simple,&mdash;the fatal influence crude
      and uncertain notions of liberty will exercise over a
      career, which, under happier direction of its energies, had
      won honor and distinction, and the impolicy of the effort,
      to substitute an adopted for a natural allegiance.

      My estimate of Napoleon may seem to some to partake of
      exaggeration; but I have carefully distinguished between the
      Hero and the Emperor, and have not suffered my unqualified
      admiration of the one to carry me on to any blind devotion
      of the other.

      Having begun this catalogue of excuses and explanations, I
      know not where to stop. So, once more asking forgiveness for
      all the errors of these volumes, I beg to subscribe myself,
      in great respect and esteem,

      Your humble and obedient servant,

      Harry Lorrequer.

      Templeogue House,

      August 26th, 1844.
